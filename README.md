## difference between Observables and Promises:
http://reactivex.io/rxjs/manual/overview.html

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj0kUzKOgGQ&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhBRAgFinJR8KHIrCdTkZcZ&index=20 
is nothing only http responce which we get asynchronously over time, http responce
Observable only use to get responce from service and to get this data we need to Subscribe it inside ts
## Observable: 
represents the idea of an invokable collection of future values or events.
## Observer: 
is a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable.
means it is a collection of callbacks return by obserable.
## Subscription:
 represents the execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for cancelling the execution.
## Operators: 
are pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like map, filter, concat, flatMap, etc.
## Subject: 
is the equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers.
## Schedulers: 
are centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens on e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame or others.
## operators:
 filter, delay, debounceTime, take, takeUntil, distinct, distinctUntilChanged

## How to use TypeScript Enum types, especially with Angular 4:
Check `right-box.component` file and user.ts file to under stand Enum concept.
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35835984/how-to-use-a-typescript-enum-value-in-an-angular2-ngswitch-statement
https://ng-run.com/edit/XpKqpMjxjZvUNKDxRxLS?open=app%2Fapp.component.ts
https://blog.rsuter.com/how-to-implement-an-enum-with-string-values-in-typescript/

* Enums allow us to define a set of named constants.
* TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

-->> String enums:
In a string enum, each member has to be constant-initialized with a string literal, or with another string enum member.
enum Direction {
    Up = "UP",
    Down = "DOWN",
    Left = "LEFT",
    Right = "RIGHT",
}

export enum utSoftwareProductFamilies {
    available ="offline",
    busy = "available",
    away = "busy",
    offline = "away",
}

enum Direction {
    Up = 1,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
}
Above, we have a numeric enum where Up is initialized with 1. All of the following members are auto-incremented from that point on. In other words, Direction.Up has the value 1, Down has 2, Left has 3, and Right has 4.

enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
}

Here, Up would have the value 0, Down would have 1, etc. This auto-incrementing behavior is useful for cases where we might not care about the member values themselves, but do care that each value is distinct from other values in the same enum.


https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/enums.html

export enum EvidenceTypeEnum {
  UNKNOWN = '',
  PASSPORT_VISA = 'passport_visa',
  PASSPORT = 'passport',
  SIGHTED_STUDENT_CARD = 'sighted_tertiary_edu_id',
  SIGHTED_KEYPASS_CARD = 'sighted_keypass_card',
  SIGHTED_PROOF_OF_AGE_CARD = 'sighted_proof_of_age_card',
}

const value = someStringFromBackend as EvidenceTypeEnum;
// Sample use in code
if (value === EvidenceTypeEnum.PASSPORT){
    console.log('You provided a passport');
    console.log(value); // `passport`
}

* Const Enums: If you have an enum definition like the following:
enum Tristate {
    False,
    True,
    Unknown
}

var lie = Tristate.False;

Here’s how to define a simple enum:
enum Transport {
  train,
  bus,
  bike,
  car
}

let myTransport = Transport.bus;
console.log(myTransport); // 1

You can access an enum value by it’s number value or by the string that’s associated with it:

enum Students {
  Ann,
  Bob,
  John,
  Zed
}

console.log(Students['John']); // 2

console.log(Students[3]); // Zed

`https://alligator.io/typescript/enums/`
Enums are zero-based, but you can change that by setting a number value of your choice on the first item. Here for example our enum will have an index that starts with 1:

enum Tools {
  hammer = 1,
  screwdriver,
  saw,
  wrench
}

console.log(Tools.saw); // 3

Or you can skip to new values, and the next values will follow:

enum Tools {
  hammer,
  screwdriver,
  saw = 100,
  wrench
}

console.log(Tools.wrench); // 101

`http://www.tutorialsteacher.com/typescript/typescript-enum`  (best)

Enums or enumerations are a new data type supported in TypeScript. Most object-oriented languages like Java and C# use enums. This is now available in TypeScript too.

In simple words, enums allow us to declare a set of named constants i.e. a collection of related values that can be numeric or string values.

There are three types of enums:

1- Numeric enum
2- String enum
3- Heterogeneous enum

## ModuleLevel Structure: To break componet on module level check folder- 2018,2019,2020 and indicator folder.
in this folder we use module concept to break component.

## extends component from header component to call method inside header component also use query param (header component , main-box component, studen.service)

## Share data between header component to any other component (check main-box component and header component)
for that we need to use (check shared-service component file)
 ` private _listners = new Subject<any>();`
    listen(): Observable<any> {
       return this._listners.asObservable();
    }
    filter(filterBy: any) {
       this._listners.next(filterBy);
    }

/**
 * 
 */
  `private filterMessageSource = new BehaviorSubject('default message'); `// we have to set default value
  //filterCurrentMessage = this.filterMessageSource.asObservable();
  listenn(): Observable<any> {
    return this.filterMessageSource.asObservable();
 }
  filterData(message: any) {
    this.filterMessageSource.next(message)
  }

    })
import { HttpClient, HttpParams } from '@angular/common/http';
prodDetails(empType1,intent1,email1):Observable<prodDetails> {
  let params = new HttpParams()
              .set('empType', empType1)
              .set('intent', intent1)
              .set('email', email1);

		return this.http.get('http://localhost:3000/prodDetails',{params:params})

## page will open in next tab when we navigate on another page:

<a href="/mainBox" target="_blank">print lInk</a> (student-details.componet.ts file)

## routing using Query param in Angular4  Query Params With Router.navigate :-- (Check student-details.component file and check 2020\primary\primary.component.ts)
If you are navigating to the route imperatively using `Router.navigate`, here’s how to pass-in query params:
goProducts() {
  this.router.navigate(['/products'], `{ queryParams: { order: 'popular' } }`);
}
This will result in a url that looks like this:
`http://localhost:4200/products?order=popular`

* You can also provide multiple query params like this: to navigate on route with different-2 param 

goProducts() {
  this.router.navigate(['/products'], `{ queryParams: { order: 'popular', 'price-range': 'not-cheap' } }`);
}

And the url looks like this:

`http://localhost:4200/products?order=popular&price-range=not-cheap`

## When to use @QueryParam vs @PathParam :
 * PathParam can be used as : /test/data/{id}/{name}
   ` /test/123/Ram`

* QueryParam can be used as :
  `/test/data?id=123&name=Ram`

## Difference between Query parameter and route parameter:
`https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular-passing-optional-query-parameters-to-route/`
The route parameters are not optional. They are essential to determining the route. The query parameters are optional.

* Query parameters are not defined in routes array like route parameters.
The query parameters are passed to the route using the queryParams directive.  This directive must be used along with the routerLink directive as shown below.
<a [routerLink]="['product']" [queryParams]="{ page:2 }">Page 2</a>
The router will construct the URL as ‘/product?pageNum=2’

* You can pass more than one Query Parameter as shown below
<a [routerLink]="['product']" [queryParams]="{ val1:2 , val2:10}">Whatever</a>
The router will construct the URL as ‘/product?val1=2&val2=10’

You can also navigate programmatically using the navigate method of the Router service as shown below:
goToPage(pageNum) {
    this.router.navigate(['/product'], { queryParams: { page: pageNum } });
}

## Reading Query Parameters:
Reading the Query parameters is similar to reading the Router Parameter. There are two ways by which you can retrieve the query parameters.
## Using queryParams observable:
The ActivatedRoute has an observable property queryParams that contain the query parameters of the activated route.

You can subscribe to the query parameter as shown below

this.sub = this.route.queryParams
    .subscribe(params => {
        this.pageNum = +params['pageNum']||0; 
    });
 
Example:
-In first page:  In Student-details component file and in 2018 folder inside primary component file

constructor(private _Activatedroute:ActivatedRoute,
               private _router:Router,
               private _productService:ProductService){
   }

 nextPage() {
      this._router.navigate(['./'], { queryParams: { pageNum: this.pageNum + 1 }, relativeTo: this._Activatedroute }   );
   }
  

-IN second component page:
constructor(private _Activatedroute:ActivatedRoute,
            private _router:Router,
            private _productService:ProductService){
}

ngOnInit() {
this.sub = this._Activatedroute.queryParams
.subscribe(params => {
this.pageNum = +params['pageNum']||0;
console.log('Query params ',this.pageNum) });
}
 ## Using snapshot property :  (Check 2020 folder with primary component)
You can also get the value of the query parameter using the snapshot

this.pageNum=this.route.snapshot.queryParams["pageNum"];

`Remember you will read only the initial value of the query parameter with the snapshot property. You will not be able to retrieve any subsequent changes to the query parameter.`

constructor(private router: Router, private activatedRoute: ActivatedRoute) { 
    console.log('activatedRoute.snapshot', activatedRoute.snapshot.queryParams.order);
    this.query=activatedRoute.snapshot.queryParams.order;
  }

## Navigating between Angular routes :
`https://www.tektutorialshub.com/navigating-between-angular-routes/`  (best side complete it ASAP)

The Angular router allows us to navigate between the routes using either `RouterLink` directive or imperatively using `router.navigate` or `router.navigatebyUrl` method of the router service.

You can navigate between routes in Angular 2 in two ways:
1- Using RouterLink Directive (use this in HTML)
2- Via Code (`router.navigate` or `router.navigatebyUrl`)

## RouterLink directive:
The RouterLink is a directive, which you can use to bind any clickable HTML element to a Route. When the user clicks on the HTML element the router will navigate to the associated Route.

<li><a [routerLink]="['product']">Product</a></li>

Will map to URL “/product” and renders the associated ProductComponent


## Navigating Using Code : this._router.navigate(['product']);

  `1- router.navigate:`
 next2020page() {
        `this.router.navigate(['2020/primary'], { queryParams: { order: 'primary' } });`
    }

  ` 2- navigate.navigateByUrl:`  this._router.navigateByUrl('product');

Use this method if you want to navigate to a URL by using the `absolute path`. The first argument is a string containing the complete URL.

## router.navigate method and relative path :

As mentioned earlier navigate method always uses the absolute path. To make Navigate method work with a relative path, we must let know the router where are we in the route tree.
This done by setting the relativeTo Property to the ActivatedRoute as shown below:

this._router.navigate(['detail'], { queryParams: { pageNum: this.pageNum + 1 }, `relativeTo: this._Activatedroute }` );

## RouterLink directive and relative path:
https://www.tektutorialshub.com/navigating-between-angular-routes/

* `Iterating Over Arrays :` There are three ways to iterate through an array:

  1- The Array.prototype.forEach method;
  2- The for loop;
  3- The for..in statement.

Additionally, two new methods are expected with the introduction of the new ECMAScript 6 standard:

  1- The for…of statement;
  2- The explicit use of the iterator.

## var will be hoisted but let will not be hoisted
## Variable declared with var keyword can be re-declared and updated in the same scope.
## Variable declared with let keyword can be updated but not re-declared.
## A variable declared with let keyword is not hoisted. If we try to use a let variable before it is declared, then it will result in a ReferenceError.

## const declarations:
The const declaration is used to declare permanent value, which cannot be changed later. It has a fixed value. The const declaration follows the same scoping rules as let declaration, but we cannot re-assign any new value to it.

If we try to re-assign the existing const variable in a code, the code will throw an error. So, we cannot re-assign any new value to an existing const variable.

function constTest(){  
  const VAR = 10;  
  console.log("Output: " +VAR);  // Output: 10  
  const VAR = 10;  
  console.log("Output: " +VAR);  //Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable  
}  
constTest();  

SyntaxError: Identifier 'VAR' has already been declared.

## TypeScript Arrow function:
Arrow function is also called a `Lambda function`. The arrow function has lexical scoping of "this" keyword.

## TypeScript Tutorial:
 * `The Benefits of Using TypeScript`
 https://tutorialzine.com/2016/07/learn-typescript-in-30-minutes
 https://www.javatpoint.com/typescript-function-overloading
 1- Due to the static typing, code written in TypeScript is more predictable, and is generally easier to debug.

  shardeData: string; // it means we can assign only string
  public getData: any; // it means we can assign any type of value
  public num: number = 45; // it means we can assign only number type value
  items: Array<string>;  // The items in the menu, an array of strings.
  items: Array<any>;  // The items in the menu, an array of any types.
  items: Array<number>;  // The items in the menu, an array of number types.

* `Static Typing:`
A very distinctive feature of TypeScript is the support of static typing. This means that you can declare the types of variables, and the compiler will make sure that they aren't assigned the wrong types of values.
Here is an example. Any variable, function argument or return value can have its type defined on initialization:
var burger: string = 'hamburger',     // String 
    calories: number = 300,           // Numeric
    tasty: boolean = true;            // Boolean

// Alternatively, you can omit the type declaration:
// var burger = 'hamburger';

// The function expects a string and an integer.
// It doesn't return anything so the type of the function itself is void.

function speak(food: string, energy: number): void {
  console.log("Our " + food + " has " + energy + " calories.");
}

function speak(food: string, energy: number): void{
  console.log("Our " + food + " has " + energy + " calories.");
}

// Arguments don't match the function parameters.
speak("tripple cheesburger", "a ton of");
main.ts(5,30): error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

* `Here are some of the most commonly used data types:`

`String -` The text type, just like in vanilla JS strings can be surrounded by 'single quotes' or "double quotes".
`Boolean -` true or false, using 0 and 1 will cause a compilation error.
`Any -` A variable with this type can have it's value set to a string, number, or anything else.
`Arrays -` Has two possible syntaxes: my_arr: number[]; or my_arr: Array<number>.
`Void -` Used on function that don't return anything.

* `Interfaces:` in this we will create some certain structure and check that comming object fits a certain structure or no.

Interfaces are used to type-check whether an object fits a certain structure. By defining an interface we can name a specific combination of variables, making sure that they will always go together. When translated to JavaScript, interfaces disappear - their only purpose is to help in the development stage.

Interfaces are capable of describing the wide range of shapes that JavaScript objects can take.

// Here we define our Food interface, its properties, and their types.
interface Food {
    name: string;
    calories: number;
}

// We tell our function to expect an object that fulfills the Food interface. 
// This way we know that the properties we need will always be available.
function speak(food: Food): void{
  console.log("Our " + food.name + " has " + food.calories + " calories.");
}
`The order of the properties does NOT matter. We just need the required properties to be present and to be the right type. If something is missing, has the wrong type, or is named differently, the compiler will warn us.`

interface Food {
    name: string;
    calories: number;
}

function speak(food: Food): void{
  console.log("Our " + food.name + " has " + food.calories + " grams.");
}

// We've made a deliberate mistake and name is misspelled as nmae.
var ice_cream = {
  nmae: "ice cream", 
  calories: 200
}

speak(ice_cream);
main.ts(16,7): error TS2345: Argument of type '{ nmae: string; calories: number; } 
is not assignable to parameter of type 'Food'. 
Property 'name' is missing in type '{ nmae: string; calories: number; }'.

`Optional Properties in interface:`
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html
Not all properties of an interface may be required. Some exist under certain conditions or may not be there at all. These optional properties are popular when creating patterns like “option bags” where you pass an object to a function that only has a couple of properties filled in.

interface `SquareConfig` {
   ` color?: string;`   // Optional Properties
   ` width?: number; `  // Optional Properties
}

function createSquare(config: `SquareConfig`): {color: string; area: number} {
    let newSquare = {color: "white", area: 100};
    if (config.color) {
        newSquare.color = config.color;
    }
    if (config.width) {
        newSquare.area = config.width * config.width;
    }
    return newSquare;
}

let mySquare = `createSquare`({color: "black"});

`Readonly properties in interface:` Some properties should only be modifiable when an object is first created. You can specify this by putting `readonly` before the name of the property:

interface Point {
    `readonly x: number;`
    `readonly y: number;`
}
You can construct a Point by assigning an object literal. After the assignment, x and y can’t be changed.
let p1: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
p1.x = 5; // error!

TypeScript comes with a ReadonlyArray<T> type that is the same as Array<T> with all mutating methods removed, so you can make sure you don’t change your arrays after creation:

let a: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let ro: ReadonlyArray<number> = a;
ro[0] = 12; // error!
ro.push(5); // error!
ro.length = 100; // error!
a = ro; // error!

`readonly vs const`
The easiest way to remember whether to use `readonly` or const is to ask whether you’re using it on a variable or a property. `Variables use const` whereas `properties use readonly`.

## Creating a Class:
You can create a class and even add fields, properties, constructors, and functions (static, prototype, instance based). The basic syntax for a class is as follows:

// TypeScript
class Car {  
    // Property (public by default)
    engine: string;

    // Constructor 
    // (accepts a value so you can initialize engine)
    constructor(engine: string) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}  

export class prodDetails {
     // Property (public by default)
	public netPrice: number;
	public invoiceNo: number;
	public discountDescription?: string;
	public buy: boolean;

	constructor(
		netPrice: number,
		invoiceNo?: number,
		discountDescription?: string,
		buy?: boolean
	){
		this.netPrice = netPrice,
		this.invoiceNo = invoiceNo,
		this.discountDescription = discountDescription,
		this.buy = buy
	}
}


## Inheritance class:

// TypeScript
class `Auto` {  
    engine: string;
    constructor(`engine`: string) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
} 
-

class ManlyTruck extends `Auto` {  
    bigTires: bool;
    constructor(engine: string, bigTires: bool) {
        `super(engine);`
        this.bigTires = bigTires;
    }
}
## infterface  and class in typeScript:
https://www.javatpoint.com/typescript-function-overloading
* The TypeScript compiler uses interfaces solely for type-checking purposes.
* Interface can implement inside class not extend and interface can extend inside another interface.
https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-define-an-interface-in-typescript
interface Shape {
    color: string;
}

interface Square extends Shape {
    sideLength: number;
}
* An interface can extend multiple interfaces, creating a combination of all of the interfaces.
interface Shape {
    color: string;
}

interface PenStroke {
    penWidth: number;
}

interface Square extends Shape, PenStroke {
    sideLength: number;
}


* an interface is simply a structural contract that defines what the properties of an object should have as a name and as a type. 

* Interface Extending Another Interface:


## Features of TypeScript: 
https://www.javatpoint.com/typescript-features

1- Object-Oriented language:  TypeScript provides a complete feature of an object-oriented programming language such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, modules, etc.

2- TypeScript supports JavaScript libraries: TypeScript supports each JavaScript elements. It allows the developers to use existing JavaScript code with the TypeScript.

3- TypeScript is portable: TypeScript is portable because it can be executed on any browsers, devices, or any operating systems. It can be run in any environment where JavaScript runs on. It is not specific to any virtual-machine for execution.

4- DOM Manipulation: TypeScript can be used to manipulate the DOM for adding or removing elements similar to JavaScript.

5- TypeScript is just a JS: TypeScript code is not executed on any browsers directly. The program written in TypeScript always starts with JavaScript and ends with JavaScript. Hence, we only need to know JavaScript to use it in TypeScript. The code written in TypeScript is compiled and converted into its JavaScript equivalent for the execution. This process is known as Trans-piled. With the help of JavaScript code, browsers can read the TypeScript code and display the output.

## Advantage of TypeScript over JavaScript:

1- TypeScript always highlights errors at compilation time during the time of development, whereas JavaScript points out errors at the runtime.

2- TypeScript supports strongly typed or static typing, whereas this is not in JavaScript.

3- TypeScript runs on any browser or JavaScript engine.

4- 

## Disadvantage of TypeScript over JavaScript

1- TypeScript takes a long time to compile the code.
2- If we run the TypeScript application in the browser, a compilation step is required to transform TypeScript into JavaScript.

## The TypeScript Compiler:
https://www.javatpoint.com/typescript-components

The TypeScript compiler (TSC) transform the TypeScript program equivalent to its JavaScript code.

Browser doesn't support the execution of TypeScript code directly. So the program written in TypeScript must be re-written in JavaScript equivalent code which supports the execution of code in the browser directly. To perform this, TypeScript comes with TypeScript compiler named "tsc." 

## Compiler Configuration:
The TypeScript compiler configuration is given in `tsconfig.json `file and looks like the following:

## TypeScript Type Annotation:

## Use of Type Annotation as a parameter:

## TypeScript Build Tools:
https://www.javatpoint.com/typescript-build-tools


## Migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript:


## Difference between TypeScript Class and Interface:
https://www.javatpoint.com/typescript-class-vs-interface
When the Typescript compiler compiles it into JavaScript, then the interface will be removed from the JavaScript file. Thus, its purpose is to help in the development stage only.


A class can extend only one class and can implement any number of the interface.
but
An interface can extend more than one interfaces but cannot implement any interface.

A class can have a constructor.
but
An interface cannot have a constructor.

The member of a class can be public, protected, or private.
but
The members of an interface are always public. 

## Multi-type variables:
In TypeScript Generics, we can define multi-type variables with a different name. We can understand it with the following example.

function displayDataType<T, U>(id:T, name:U): void {   
  console.log("DataType of Id: "+typeof(id) + "\nDataType of Name: "+ typeof(name));    
}  
displayDataType<number, string>(101, "Abhishek");  

## Generic with non-generic Type:
We can also use generic types with other non-generic types.

function displayDataType<T>(id:T, name:string): void {   
  console.log("DataType of Id: "+typeof(id) + "\nDataType of Name: "+ typeof(name));    
}  
displayDataType<number>(1, "Abhishek")




##  Interface Inheritance:
We can inherit the interface from the other interfaces. In other words, Typescript allows an interface to be inherited from zero or more base types.
The base type can be a class or interface. We can use the "extends" keyword to implement inheritance among interfaces.

interface Person {   
   name:string  
   age:number  
}  
interface Employee extends Person {   
   gender:string  
   empCode:number  
}  

Let us take the above example, which helps us to understand the multiple interface inheritance.
interface Person {   
   name:string    
}  
interface PersonDetail {   
    age:number  
    gender:string  
}  
interface Employee extends Person, PersonDetail {   
    empCode:number  
}  

## TypeScript Type Assertion:


## Interface in a class:
TypeScript also allows us to use the interface in a class. A class implements the interface by using the implements keyword. We can understand it with the below example.

// defining interface for class  
interface Person {  
    firstName: string;  
    lastName: string;  
    age: number;  
    FullName();  
    GetAge();  
}  

// implementing the interface  
class Employee implements Person {  
    firstName: string;  
    lastName: string;  
    age:number;  
    FullName() {  
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;  
    } 
}

## Difference between interface and inheritance:


## TypeScript Enums:
 Enums are a new data type supported in TypeScript. It is used to define the set of named constants, i.e., a collection of related values. TypeScript supports both numeric and string-based enums. We can define the enums by using the enum keyword.

 There are three types of Enums in TypeScript. These are:

* Numeric Enums
* String Enums
* Heterogeneous Enums

## JavaScript Constructor Method :
https://www.javatpoint.com/javascript-oops-constructor-method

Points to remember:
1- JavaScript allows us to use parent class constructor through super keyword.
2- The class can contain one constructor method only.
3- The constructor keyword is used to declare a constructor method.

Constructor Method Example:
class Employee {  
  constructor() {  
    this.id=101;  
    this.name = "Martin Roy";  
  }   
}  

## Constructor Method Example: super keyword:
class `CompanyName`  
{  
  constructor()  
  {  
    this.company="Javatpoint";  
  }  
}  
class Employee extends `CompanyName` {  
  constructor(id,name) {  
   `super`();  
    this.id=id;  
    this.name=name;  
  }   
}

## JavaScript static Method :

The JavaScript provides static methods that belong to the class instead of an instance of that class. So, an instance is not required to call the static method. These methods are called directly on the class itself.

## JavaScript Encapsulation:
The JavaScript Encapsulation is a process of binding the data (i.e. variables) with the functions acting on that data. It allows us to control the data and validate it. To achieve an encapsulation in JavaScript: -

## JavaScript Inheritance:

## JavaScript Polymorphism:
https://www.javatpoint.com/javascript-oops-polymorphism

The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm that provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects.

## JavaScript Abstraction:
https://www.javatpoint.com/javascript-oops-abstraction

An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.

Points to remember:
1- We cannot create an instance of Abstract Class.
1- It reduces the duplication of code.


## Interfaces use in Class : if we need some common value use in all over class then in that case we will use interface to define all common value use in interface and implements that interface into class.
https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/typescript-class-vs-interface-99c0ae1c2136
One of the coolest parts of TypeScript is how it allows you to define complex type definitions in the form of interfaces. This is helpful when you have a complex type that you want to use in your application such as an object that contains other properties. For example, we could define an interface for a Car class such that every car must have an engine and a color like this.

// TypeScript by `interface` method
interface `ICar`{  
    engine: string;
    color: string;
}

class Car `implements` `ICar` {  
    constructor (public engine: string, public color: string) {
    }
} 

// By class `extends` method
class `Test`{
    a: number;
    b: string;
}

class Test2 `extends` `Test`{
    c: number;
}

`Before we get started, when you extend a class, you use the extends keyword. You extend a class, and implement an interface`
// implement is use for infterface use in side class
// exted is use for class use in another class

https://shermandigital.com/blog/typescript-interface-vs-class/

`To decide whether to create a class or an interface, consider whether your needs are limited to enforcing the shape of an object. If so, you can utilize an interface. If you also need control over how the object is initialized and how its properties and functions interact, use a class.`

https://jameshenry.blog/typescript-classes-vs-interfaces/

Let’s start off with an example in order to focus in on what we are trying to understand in this post:

fetch('https://jameshenry.blog/foo/bar')
    .then((response) => {
        console.log(response.status) // Some HTTP status code, such as 200
    })

If we let TypeScript take a look at this code as it is now, it would be forced to infer the type of the response parameter as any. There is no way for it to know, just by analysing the code, what the type should be.

At this point, to increase the type safety of our program, we would want to add our own explicit type annotation to response, in order to tell the TypeScript compiler what we believe the type should be:

// `Response` will be defined here...

fetch('https://jameshenry.blog/foo/bar')
    .then((response: `Response`) => {
        console.log(response.status)
    })


Now we have reached the central question that motivated this blog post… Should our new` Response type be defined as an interface or a class?`

`An interface is only used by TypeScript at compile time, and is then removed. Interfaces do not end up in our final JavaScript output.`

Let’s complete the section on interfaces by finally defining our dead simple Response type as an interface:

interface Response {
    status: number // Some HTTP status code, such as 200
}

fetch('https://jameshenry.blog/foo/bar')
    .then((response: Response) => {
        console.log(response.status)
    })

We can see that our extra type information at compile time has had no impact on our program at run time! The magic of TypeScript interfaces!

`Using a Class in place of Interface:`
Let’s now take our example and redefine our Response type as a class instead of an interface.
class Response {
    status: number // Some HTTP status code, such as 200
}

fetch('https://jameshenry.blog/foo/bar')
    .then((response: Response) => {
        console.log(response.status)
    })
As we can see, in this case it is simply a matter of changing interface to class, and if we pass our code through the TypeScript compiler, we will still have the exact same level of type-safety and produce no compile time errors! So far, the behaviour is identical.

`The real difference comes when we consider our compiled JavaScript output.`

`the biggest difference between a class and an interface is that a class provides an implementation of something, not just its shape.`

## First class function in javaScript:First Class Functions:((or “first-class citizens”))

`“First-class functions are just like primitives and objects”`
And First class funbction can be:
* First-class functions Assigned to variables

var `func` = function (param) {
  return param;
}
document.body.innerHTML += func("Did I just call a variable? Yep!");

* First-class functions Returned from functions

* First-class functions Passed as arguments to functions

In JavaScript functions are first-class. This mean that with functions you can do everything you can do with other types such as assigning them to variables.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function

A programming language is said to have `First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable`.
 For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an `argument` to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned `as a value` to a   .

const foo = function() {
   console.log("foobar");
}
// Invoke it using the variable
foo();

We assigned an Anonymous Function in a Variable, then we used that variable to invoke the function by adding parentheses () at the end.

`First class functions means the function that is define as  constants, variables, placed as array elements and even set as values of keys on an object is call First class functions.`

* `Functions as constants`

* `Functions as values of keys of an object`
const functionAsObjectProperty = {
    print: (value) => console.log(value)
};

functionAsObjectProperty.print("mic check"); // "mic check"

## Higher-Order Function in JavaScript:

A higher order function is any function which takes a function as an argument, returns a function, or both.

https://hackernoon.com/javascript-and-functional-programming-pt-2-first-class-functions-4437a1aec217

`functions that accept other functions as arguments or return a function is call Higher-Order Function.`

In this example; We need to return a function from another function - We can return a function because we treated function in JavaScript as a value.

function sayHello() {
   return function() {
      console.log("Hello!");
   }
}
`here sayHello() is a High order Function.`

`A function that returns a function called Higher-Order Function`

`A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function.`

For example, `filter, map, and reduce, among others.` is High order function. One way to think of a higher-order function is: It's a function that accepts (what's typically called) a callback function. 

## what is meaning of Functional Programming  in javaScript:

Functional programming is a declarative paradigm, meaning that the program logic is expressed without explicitly describing the flow control.

Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative,
`functional programming:`
  1- Pure functions
  2- Function composition
  3- Avoid shared state
  4- Avoid mutating state
  5- Avoid side effects

https://codeburst.io/functional-programming-in-javascript-e57e7e28c0e5  (emp in ES6)

functional programimg is concept which need to follow in coding and try to break code into small small function
so that it is easy to debug and also easy in case of unit testing.
 Functional programming distinguishes between `pure and impure functions`.

* `pure functions:` 
A pure function is a function which:
   1- Given the same inputs, always returns the same output, and
   2- Has no side-effects

Pure function always return same value for same arguments.
https://opensource.com/article/17/6/functional-javascript
A pure function must satisfy both of the following properties:
`Referential transparency: `The function always gives the same return value for the same arguments. This means that the function cannot depend on any mutable state.
`Side-effect free:` The function cannot cause any side effects. Side effects may include I/O (e.g., writing to the console or a log file), modifying a mutable object, reassigning a variable, etc.

First, the `multiply function` is an example of a pure function. It always returns the same output for the same input, and it causes no side effects.

-- They're easier to reason about and debug because they `don't depend on mutable state.`
-- The return value can be cached or "memoized" to avoid recomputing it in the future.

* `impure functions:` impure function return different-2 value for same argument value.

We decided that it is an impure function, because the heightRequirement could be reassigned.

let heightRequirement = 46;

function canRide(height) {
  return height >= heightRequirement;
}
// Every half second, set heightRequirement to a random number between 0 and 200.
setInterval(() => heightRequirement = Math.floor(Math.random() * 201), 500);

const mySonsHeight = 47;

// Every half second, check if my son can ride.
// Sometimes it will be true and sometimes it will be false.
setInterval(() => console.log(canRide(mySonsHeight)), 500);

## Immutability:
https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0

An immutable object is an object that can’t be modified after it’s created. Conversely, a mutable object is any object which can be modified after it’s created

Immutability is a central concept of functional programming because without it, the data flow in your program is lossy.

In JavaScript, it’s important not to confuse `const`, with `immutability`. `const` creates a variable name binding which `can’t be reassigned after creation`. `const` does not create `immutable objects`. You can’t change the object that the binding refers to, `but you can still change the properties of the object,` which means that bindings created with `const are mutable`, `not immutable`.

const a = {
  foo: 'Hello',
  bar: 'world',
  baz: '!'
};

a.foo = 'Goodbye'; // it is mutable so we can say that `const` does not create `immutable objects`.

`Immutable objects can’t be changed at all.` You can make a value truly immutable by `deep freezing the object`. JavaScript has a method that freezes an object one-level deep:

const a = Object.freeze({
  foo: 'Hello',
  bar: 'world',
  baz: '!'
});

a.foo = 'Goodbye'; // it is immutable
/`/ Error: Cannot assign to read only property 'foo' of object Object`

But frozen objects are only superficially immutable. For example, the following object is mutable:

const a = Object.freeze({
  foo: { greeting: 'Hello' },
  bar: 'world',
  baz: '!'
});

a.foo.greeting = 'Goodbye';  // it is mutable

console.log(`${ a.foo.greeting }, ${ a.bar }${a.baz}`);

As you can see, the top level primitive properties of a frozen object can’t change, but any property which is also an object (including arrays, etc…) can still be mutated — so even frozen objects are not immutable unless you walk the whole object tree and freeze every object property.

## Side Effects : A side effect is any application state change that is observable outside the called function other than its return value. 


## Declarative vs Imperative :

Functional programming is a `declarative paradigm`, meaning that the program logic is expressed without explicitly describing the flow control.

`Imperative` programs spend lines of code describing the specific steps used to achieve the desired results — the flow control: How to do things.

const doubleMap = numbers => {
  const doubled = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    doubled.push(numbers[i] * 2);
  }
  return doubled;
};

console.log(doubleMap([2, 3, 4])); // [4, 6, 8]


`Declarative` programs abstract the flow control process, and instead spend lines of code describing the data flow: What to do. The how gets abstracted away.
`https://codeburst.io/learn-understand-javascripts-map-function-ffc059264783`
const doubleMap = numbers => numbers.map(n => n * 2);
console.log(doubleMap([2, 3, 4])); // [4, 6, 8]

## What is a Function?

A function is a process which takes some input, called arguments, and produces some output called a return value.

`https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-functional-programming/ ( most imp link for javaScript try to follow and complete it)`

## Browser load js then how can we understand typescript:

`By using source map`. and when we run `ng serve` then by default `source map` is `true` and when we debug code in typeScript then each line of code in typeScript is map to converted js code and by using source map concept we are able to debug the code in typeScript code browser.
5- `ng serve --sourcemap=true`  (always run this code to findout exact code coverage in Angular5)
6- `ng build --prod --source-map=true ` (always run this code to findout exact code coverage in Angular6)

in `ng serve` source map is true by default and in `ng build --prod` source map false by default.

## Why we use typeScript in place of JS if same thing do using JS:
   1- TpyeScript is tightly couple means in this we define type of any veriable but in javaScript not required.
   2- 

   TypeScript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language.In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some additional features.

   ## Why Use TypeScript?
     1- Compilation −

   `The TypeScript Compiler`
The TypeScript compiler is itself a .ts file compiled down to JavaScript (.js) file. The TSC (TypeScript Compiler) is a source-to-source compiler (transcompiler / transpiler).

### Integrating PrimeNG with Angular CLI:-

`PrimeNG` from PrimeFaces is one such option. It offers a selection of pre-built themes and UI components for data presentation, form inputs, menus, charts, overlays and more.

https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/setup (Setup and use it)
http://blogs.bytecode.com.au/glen/2016/10/27/primeng-with-angular-cli.html
https://alligator.io/angular/primeng/ 
http://www.javainuse.com/angular/angular2_datagrid
https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/prime-ng-data-table-for-angular.html

`npm install primeng --save`
`npm install primeicons --save`
`npm install font-awesome --save`

"styles": [
        "styles.css",
        "../node_modules/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css",
        "../node_modules/primeng/resources/themes/omega/theme.css" , 
        "../node_modules/primeng/resources/primeng.css",
      //  "../node_modules/primeng/resources/themes/nova-light/theme.css",
        "../node_modules/primeng/resources/themes/darkness/theme.css",
        "../node_modules/primeicons/primeicons.css",
        "../node_modules/primeng/resources/primeng.min.css"
      ],
Here we’re using the `darkness theme`, but you can choose between 17 available themes like  kasper, voclain or cruze, just to give you a few examples.

Now import all required module in app.module.ts file which are required in project

## `Now let’s setup our app module to include the UI components we want:`

import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

`import { AccordionModule } from 'primeng/primeng';`
`import { PanelModule } from 'primeng/primeng`';
`import { ButtonModule } from 'primeng/primeng';`
`import { RadioButtonModule } from 'primeng/primeng';`

import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    BrowserAnimationsModule,
    FormsModule,
    `AccordionModule`,
    `PanelModule`,
    `ButtonModule`,
    `RadioButtonModule`
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}

Now we can use it inside all required component check component `student-details.component.html` to check all
example of `PrimeNG`.

`NOTE:- PrimeNG is same as material which are use in angular4 to give design to UI.`

BY using `PrimeNG` we can design attractive design in Angular6.

## PrimeNG – UI components for Angular 2:-
`https://yakovfain.com/2016/10/06/primeng-ui-components-for-angular-2/`

Angular 2 framework will become a complete platform for developing Web apps when it’ll offer a library of rich UI components.` Angular Material 2` currently offers 16 UI components, which is not enough for commercial applications. Based on the current speed of development

Meanwhile there are third-party libraries of UI components that you can use with your Angular 2 apps today. In this blog I’ll show you how to get started with the library called `PrimeNG` that already includes more than 60 UI components.

This library (`PrimeNG`)offers` such components as Accordion, Panel, Grid, Dialog, Menu, charts, drag and drop, and many more.` To see all `PrimeNG components` visit `http://www.primefaces.org/primeng`.

I’ve created a small seed project that can get you started in a minute. In this project I use three `PrimeNG` components: `InputText`, `Button`, and `ConfirmDialog`. `Each PrimeNG component is offered as a module, and you need to add the required components to your @NgModule declaration, for example:`

@NgModule({
    imports:[ BrowserModule,
              `InputTextModule`,
              `ButtonModule`,
              `ConfirmDialogModule`
              ],
    declarations: [ AppComponent ],
    bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ]
})

## redux ngrx store in Angular4:

## AfterViewInit: call when the component’s view has been initialised. Applies to components only.

https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/angular-2-component-lifecycle-hooks-fa5a84b4b64d

`AfterViewInit` is A callback method that is invoked immediately after Angular has completed initialization of a component's view. It is invoked only once when the view is instantiated.

`ngAfterViewInit(): void`
`Parameters`
 There are no parameters.
`Returns`
 void

@Component({selector: 'my-cmp', template: `...`})
class MyComponent implements AfterViewInit {
  `ngAfterViewInit`() {
    // ...
  }
}

##  angular 2 access child component property from parent component:
https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-viewchild/  (best)


* `@ViewChild decorator:` When we need reference of child component in parent component to access method and property of the child component inside parent component. (check main-box component)
 We can also use @ViewChild decorator: to access DOM element.

 @ViewChild(ColorSampleComponent) primarySampleComponent: ColorSampleComponent; // this is method to use component inside the parent componet

  * `When are variables injected via @ViewChild available?:`
The value of this injected member variable and method of child component is not immediately available at component construction time!. means when we inject child compnet in parent component using `@vieChild` then method and property of child component not present in at construction time !.only loade when  all viwe part load complete.

Angular will fill in this property automatically, but only later in the component lifecycle, after the ` view initialization is completed`.

* `The AfterViewInit Lifecycle Hook :`
If we want to write component initialization code that uses the `references injected by @ViewChild`, we need to do it inside the `AfterViewInit` lifecycle hook. means use `AfterViewInit lifecycle` hook to initializ code of reference component injected by @ViewChild.

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html'
})
export class AppComponent implements  AfterViewInit {
  .....
    
  `@ViewChild(ColorSampleComponent)` `primarySampleComponent: ColorSampleComponent;`// this is method to use component inside the parent componet

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    console.log('Values on ngAfterViewInit():');
    `console.log("primaryColorSample:", this.primarySampleComponent);`
  }  
  .....
}

* Can we use ngOnInit() instead of ngAfterViewInit()? to initializ code of reference component injected by @ViewChild:

* What is the scope of the @ViewChild template queries? :

* Visibility scope of @ViewChild template queries :

* `Using @ViewChild to inject a reference to a DOM element:`
Instead of injecting a direct child component, we might want to interact directly with a plain HTML element of the template, such as for example the h2 title tag inside AppComponent.

In order to do that, we need to first assign a template reference to the HTML tag that we want to inject

`<h2 #title>Choose Brand Colors:</h2>`

As we can see, we have assigned the `#title` template reference to the h2 tag. We can now have the h2 element injected directly into our component class in the following way:

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html'
})
export class AppComponent implements  AfterViewInit {
  .....
  
  `@ViewChild('title')`
 ` title: ElementRef;`  // this is method to use DOM element using `@viewChild`.

  `ngAfterViewInit`() {
    console.log('Values on ngAfterViewInit():');
    `console.log("title:", this.title.nativeElement);` // now we select h2 elements
  }

  .....
}

As we can see, we are passing the string 'title' to the @ViewChild decorator, which corresponds to the name of the template reference applied to the h2 tag.

Because h2 is a plain HTML element and not an Angular component, what we get injected this time is a wrapped reference to the native DOM element of the h2 tag:

`ElementRef simply wraps the native DOM element, and we can retrieve it by accessing the nativeElement property.`

Using the `nativeElement` property, we can now apply any native DOM operation to the h2 title tag, such as for example addEventListener().

## Using @ViewChild to inject a reference to the DOM element of a component:
https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-viewchild/
https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/3922
we would like to get the DOM element that is linked to the component! This is still possible, by using the second argument of the @ViewChild decorator:

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html'
})
export class AppComponent implements  AfterViewInit {
   ....
   
  `@ViewChild('primaryColorSample', {read: ElementRef})` // this is use to find out DOM elements of the child component
  sample: ElementRef;

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    console.log('Values on ngAfterViewInit():');
    console.log("sample:", this.sample.nativeElement);
  }

  ....
}
As we can see, we are passing a second argument containing a configuration object with the read property set to ElementRef.

This read property will specify exactly what we are trying to inject, in case that there are multiple possible injectables available.

In this case, we are using the read property to specify that we want to get the DOM element (wrapped by ElementRef) of the matched template reference, and not the component.

## Using @ViewChild to inject a reference to one of several directives:

As our application uses more and more directives and libraries, we will likely need the read property more and more.

## Conclusion of @ViewChild decorator:

The @ViewChild decorator allows us to inject into a component class references to elements used inside its template, that's what we should use it for.

Using @ViewChild we can easily inject components, directives or plain DOM elements. We can even override the defaults of @ViewChild and specify exactly we need to inject, in case that multiple options are available.


## Why we don't always need @ViewChild :


## Angular 2 @ViewChild in *ngIf:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39366981/angular-2-viewchild-in-ngif

## Angular 2 @ViewChild returns undefined :
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39256703/angular-2-viewchild-returns-undefined


##  ViewChild annotation returns undefined :
https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/5870
http://infevo.net/angular-viewchild-annotation-returns-undefined/  (red ASAP)

`So how will we fix that? We have two solutions for this one. Using hidden or style.display attribute.`

- Solution #1: Hidden attribute.:

- Solution #2: Style.display attribute:

## Another solutin is:- The solution is to use the @ViewChildren instead of @ViewChild and subscribe the changes subscription that is executed when the component is ready.
https://expertcodeblog.wordpress.com/2018/01/12/angular-resolve-error-viewchild-annotation-returns-undefined/  (best)
also check- main-box component file .

## best way to use like as below:

  <div class="row"> <h2 class="{{labelSize}}-lable color-{{textColor}}"> Abhinav Singh</h2></div>  // child component

    <app-left-box  labelSize="regular" textColor="red"></app-left-box> /// in parent component

    in css file:
    .regular-lable{
      font-size="14px"
    }
    .color-red{
      color:red;
    }

## What is the difference between Subject and BehaviorSubject?:
https://alligator.io/rxjs/subjects/
https://medium.com/@luukgruijs/understanding-rxjs-behaviorsubject-replaysubject-and-asyncsubject-8cc061f1cfc0

https://netbasal.com/understanding-subjects-in-rxjs-55102a190f3   (follow it)

https://thinkster.io/tutorials/learn-rxjs-observables/using-behaviorsubject-for-values-that-change-over-time (best folow it)
check file search-student component and shared-service file :

* Data can be pushed into the subject using its next method:
    private searchUpdated: Subject<string> = new Subject<string>();
 this.searchUpdated.next(value.target.value);

## ngOnChange concept incase of @input/@output concept and update value :- (parent and child component)

ngOnChange (){} it will return all changes data value in a component in object form and we canaccess it as per requirements.

https://ngdev.space/angular-2-input-property-changes-detection-3ccbf7e366d2  (best)


`It’s called before ngOnInit and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change.`

We can use `ngOnChange` in place of @input set concept because by using ngOnChange we can check all changes in a component but by using @input set we can check only single value changes. And if we want to do any thing with @nput value then we have to use below url code.
So if we want to apply any logic based on value receive from @Input or @outPut in any component then `ngOnChange`
is best approach to do it.


 `ngOnChanges()` is called only when the reference of object is changed in parent component. If we change only values of properties of an input user object then `ngOnChanges()` method will not run. In our Angular application `OnChanges` can be used for change detection of input properties.
`https://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-4-onchanges-simplechanges-example`

 ` Suppose there is a change in input value, then following property can be used to detect changes.`

 ` previousValue:` Keeps previous value of input property. 
  `currentValue:` Keeps current value of input property. 
  `isFirstChange(): `Boolean value that tells whether the new value is the first value assigned. 

  `SimpleChanges` is the interface that represents the changes object for all input property. `SimpleChanges` has the key as input property names and values are the instances of `SimpleChange` class.

  A component that needs to detect changes in its data-bound property of a directive, has to implement `OnChanges` interface and override its `ngOnChanges()` method. It has the argument as `SimpleChanges` that is used to get `new` and `previous` values of input property.
* `OnChanges with @Input() Primitive Type:` check in (parent and child component)
* `OnChanges with @Input() User Object Type:` Need to check and implements Example:

* create new module name 
* use component in that new module
* use that new module into app.module.ts
* all component definde into only new created module no need to define it into app.module.ts file

## ncu (npm-check-updates) is use to check version of which are define in package :

* Run ncu with -u to upgrade package.json -->>  ncu -u
* run ncu -a --->>> ncu -a
* 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates/v/2.0.0-alpha3  (check)
https://60devs.com/npm-install-specific-version.html  (to check how ti install package)
If you have to install an older version of a package, just specify it

npm install <package>@<version>

For example: 
* npm install express@3.0.0
* npm install lodash@4.17.4
* npm install lodash@^4.0.0

* This command installs lodash in the current folder and fetches the latest available version.
`npm install lodash`

* If you know the exact version of the package, you can append it to the package name after the @ character:
  `npm install lodash@4.17.4`


Both aforementioned examples don’t modify package.json and don’t add installed modules to the list of dependencies. Use –save to add the installed module to the package.json’s dependencies and –save-dev to add it to devDependencies. If you install a module without defining a specific version (i.e. without any version or using a semantic range), NPM will add the semantic range to the package.json as is. To prevent this, use –save-exact flag in addition to –save or –save-dev. This flag will force NPM to store the exact module version in the package.json.

So Install like as below-:
1- npm install lodash --save --save-exact  (install exact version)
2- npm install lodash --save-dev --save-exact  (install exact version)
3- npm install lodash --save  (install semantic range version)
4- npm install lodash --save-dev  (install semantic range version)

NOTE-:
* `npm install lodash --save --save-exact` - installs the latest version and saves the exact version in the dependencies in the package.json.

* `npm install lodash --save-dev --save-exact` - installs the latest version and saves the exact version in the devDependencies map in the package.json.

* `npm install lodash --save` - installs the latest version and saves the semantic range in the dependencies in the package.json. E.g. `"lodash": "^4.17.4"`. (It means not a exact version some range of package)

* Specifying `--save-exact` alone is not sufficient. You need to define either --save or --save-dev and --save-exact. For example, npm install mocha --save-dev --save-exact or npm install lodash --save --save-exact

* --save, --save-exact, --save-dev obviously don’t work together with the -g flag which installs the module globally.




npm-check-updates(ncu) allows you to upgrade your `package.json` dependencies to the latest versions, regardless of existing version constraints.

## What’s New in Angular 6?

`https://dzone.com/articles/whats-new-in-angular-6` (new feature in Angular6)

1-: ` Registering Providers:`

A way to do that is to use the `providedIn` property in the injectable decorator. `ProvidedIn` tells us about the root module which is responsible for `creating an instance of the services`. By this way, `services will be available to an entire application.`

//myservice.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
@Injectable({
  `providedIn: 'root',`  // this is new in Angular6
})
export class MyService {
  constructor() { }
}

2-: ` Angular CLI:`

CLI projects will have `angular.json` instead of `.angular-cli.json` for configuration.

## Key attributes of Angular 5 :-

## How to extend one component into another component to use method of another component:-

So in case of extends concept we need to create `instance as public instead of private in constructor`.like as below we want to method from `date-picker component` to `stockchange component` then we will extend `date-picker component` in `stockchange.component.ts` like as below. check both component.

* `In Date-picker.components`

`constructor(public sharedServiceService: SharedServiceService) {}`

* `In stockchange.component.ts`

export class StockchangeComponent `extends DatePickerComponent` implements OnInit {
 constructor(
  `  public sharedServiceService: SharedServiceService` // this is come from `DatePickerComponent` constructor block in DatePickerComponent.
    ) {
       `super(sharedServiceService);`  //in this parameter same as exteds component
     }
}

Also check `student-details.component` and `stockchange.component` file 
by using we can share variable like as below:-
we want to use method from `stockchange.component.ts` to `student-details.component` then in that case we can  extend `stockchange.component.ts` into `student-details.component` like as below:

`export class StudentDetailsComponent extends StockchangeComponent implements OnInit {}`

##  Share html element from one component to another component using Services.:

Share element name from one component to another component `using servcie only`,  the check below folder:
 * shared-servicve.service.ts
 * date-picker folder
 * stockcchange folder

## Setup jQuery with Angular6:- http://www.daterangepicker.com/

https://itsolutionstuff.com/post/bootstrap-daterangepicker-example-code-with-demo-using-daterangepickerjsexample.html (jQuery daterangepicker)

1- First install jQuery using npm as follows:-
(https://medium.com/@swarnakishore/how-to-include-and-use-jquery-in-angular-cli-project-592e0fe63176)

 npm install jquery --save

2- Second go to the ./angular-cli.json file at the root of your Angular CLI project folder, and find the scripts: [] property, and include the path to jQuery as follows:-

"scripts": [ "../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js" ]	

3- Now Run:  ng serve

4- npm i bootstrap-daterangepicker --save    (https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap-daterangepicker)

5- npm install moment --save

## How to set envirment to run code in dev,QA,UAT,Prod:

`http://tattoocoder.com/angular-cli-using-the-environment-option/`

`https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/7793`
`https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/6543`

So to run code in different-2 env we need to build in different way check it in local follow Steps :

1- create two server: and point all json request for in each server as per requirement
2- To create server we need to use express.js
3- Write some logic in environments for difference-2 environments

1- Create server:- Run noder server on different-2 port using following cmd.
   :-  json-server --watch country.json --port 3001  (dev)
   :-  json-server --watch country.json --port 3002   (Pro)
   :-  json-server --watch country.json --port 3003    (QA)

NOTE- Change port name based on Env decide to run code:

`2- ng serve --environment=dev`

https://medium.com/@OlegVaraksin/configure-angular-cli-build-for-different-stages-in-cloud-7c22410c724b

ng build --env=dev
ng build --env=test
ng build --env=prod

`https://medium.com/@balramchavan/separating-production-and-development-http-urls-using-environment-ts-file-in-angular-4c2dd0c5a8b0 `  (follow above link to Separating production and development HTTP URLs using environment.ts file in Angular) 
`https://github.com/ultrasonicsoft/configurable-http-url-demo ` (check code form this link HTTP URLs using environment.ts)

##  the same build will be deployed on dev, test, prod stages, etc. How to achieve this?

## difference in Behaviour Subject and Subject:-

## build project:- Bundling for Production: https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler

The --prod meta-flag compiles with AOT by default.

`ng build --prod --aot` or `ng build --prod`  (to build code for prod) (we can remove unnecessary code by using this from component only not from plugin file)

With new CLI apps, You can mention exclude files and paths in `tsconfig.app.json`. where `tsconfig.app.json` is default file as part of angular cli seed project teample.

"exclude": [
"test.ts",
"/*.spec.ts",
"testing/helpers/.ts"
]

`https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/3953`(during build time spec file consider or not how can we check)
`https://blog.angularindepth.com/a-deep-deep-deep-deep-deep-dive-into-the-angular-compiler-5379171ffb7a ` (need to check)
`https://medium.com/@trekhleb/how-to-create-aot-jit-compatible-angular-4-library-with-external-scss-html-templates-9da6e68dac6e`(need to check)

## To check that which plugin how much sapce take in project run the following command.:-

1- `npm run build-prod` : this is use to build code in production mode
2- `npm run stats`: this is use to open project in stats mode in browser to check size of each bundle used in code

## Analyzing bundle size with the Angular CLI and Webpack: to check bundle size used in code:

`https://coryrylan.com/blog/analyzing-bundle-size-with-the-angular-cli-and-webpack`
`https://github.com/coryrylan/ng-pokedex/blob/master/package.json`
`https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer` (Webpack Bundle Analyzer)
https://blog.angularindepth.com/optimize-angular-bundle-size-in-4-steps-4a3b3737bf45 (Monitor your bundle size)
`To use this tool use the following steps:`

1- Install via npm to your CLI project: npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
npm i -g webpack-bundle-analyzer@latest
2- Once installed add the following entry to the npm scripts in the package.json: "bundle-report": "webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/stats.json"
3- Once added run the following command: npm run bundle-report

`set following code in package.json file`
 "scripts": {
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "ng serve",
    "build": "ng build --prod",
	"build-prod": "ng build --prod --stats-json",  /or try: ng build --stats-json --build-optimizer=false --vendor-chunk=true  (try https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer/issues/174)
    "test": "ng test",
    "lint": "ng lint",
    "e2e": "ng e2e",
	"stats": "webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/stats.json"
  },
  then run following code:
1- `npm run build-prod `
2- `npm run stats`  (by using this automic one browser open )
 when we check graph in browser then following options come--
 * `state Size:-` This is the "input" size of your files, before any transformations like minification.means actual size before minified.
 * `parsed Size:-` This is the "output" size of your files. If you're using a Webpack plugin such as Uglify, then this value will reflect the minified size of your code.means size after minifide the code.
 * `Gzipped Size:-` This is the size of running the parsed bundles/modules through gzip compression.

## To remove local file from momentum.js add some file into tsconfig.app.json:

{
  "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "../out-tsc/app",
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "module": "es2015",
    "types": [],
    "path":{
      "moment":[
        ".node_modules/moment/min/moment.min.js"  // this is use to remove file
      ]
    }
  },
  "exclude": [
    "test.ts",
    "**/*.spec.ts"
  ]
}

## Tree shaking: Remove all code from each component which are not used in project.

`https://medium.com/@tkssharma/can-we-make-angular-2-0-app-more-faster-with-aot-lazy-load-1c81576570e6`

`ng build --prod --verbose > build-file.txt`  (it is use to check main concept of Tree Shakin and check which code remove from component) -- To check all define and undefined value.

Tree shaking is a term commonly used in the JavaScript context for dead-code elimination from component which code import and define but not in use in that component.

# TestBed -->>> It will let us create our components, so they can be used to run unit tests.

https://alligator.io/angular/introduction-unit-testing/
 beforeEach(`async`(() => {
        `TestBed.configureTestingModule`({
           ` declarations:` [MainBoxComponent, LeftBoxComponent, RightBoxComponent],
           ` providers:` [
                { provide: StudentService, `useClass`: StudentServiceMock },
                { provide: ElementRef, `useClass`: MockElementRef },
                SharedServiceService
            ],
           ` imports:` [RouterTestingModule, FormsModule]
        })
        .compileComponents();  //compile the declared components.
    }));
`TestBed & Component Fixtures:`
TestBed is the main utility available for Angular-specific testing. You’ll use `TestBed.configureTestingModule` in your test suite’s `beforeEach block` and give it an object with similar values as a regular` NgModule` for` declarations, providers and imports.` You can then chain a call to `compileComponents()` to tell Angular to compile the declared components.

`You can create a component fixture` with` TestBed.createComponent`. `Fixtures have access to a debugElement`, which `will give you access to the internals of the component fixture`.

Change detection isn’t done automatically in DOM incase of test case , so you’ll call detectChanges on a fixture to tell Angular to run change detection.

`Async:`
async will allow the next test not to start until the async finishes all it's tasks.means before executing each test case first all dependency component ,service will be load after that test will start execution.

Wrapping the callback function of a test or the first argument of beforeEach with async allows Angular to perform asynchronous compilation and wait until the content inside of the async block to be ready before continuing.

With Angular (in a Jasmine environment), Angular will actually call `done` behind the scenes, when we use `async`. It will keep track of all the `asynchronous` tasks in the Zone, and when they are all finished, `done` will be called behind the scenes.

`We can use `async` when dependencies involve `asynchronous` handling. This will internally create a zone and deal with any asynchronous processing.`

`async` will allow the next test not to start until the `async` finishes all it's tasks. What `async` does is wrap the callback in a Zone, where all asynchronous tasks (e.g. setTimeout) are tracked. Once all the asynchronous tasks are complete, then the async completes.

`fixture = TestBed.createComponent(RightBoxComponent)`;
After configuring TestBed, you tell it to create an instance of the component-under-test. Here, `TestBed.createComponent` creates an instance of `RightBoxComponent` and returns a component test fixture.

`DebugElement, which is a handle on the component’s DOM element.`

In the remaining tests, we use our `DebugElement` to trigger button clicks. Notice how the `DebugElement` has a query method that takes a predicate. Here we use the By utility and its css method to find a specific element in the template. `DebugElement` also has a `nativeElement` method, for direct access to the DOM.

`fixture.detectChanges():=`
`The detectChanges method on the fixture forces Angular to trigger a change detection,` so new values appears on the DOM element. means when we will call any event in test case then after calling event in test case DOM will not update directly so to update DOM we need to call `fixture.detectChanges()` after each event. and in Production DOM will automatic will update after event calling but in case of unit test case to update DOM we need to call `fixture.detectChanges()` to update DOM.

## Unit test case for DOM access in spec file:Component DOM testing:-

`https://angular.io/guide/testing`
`https://alligator.io/angular/introduction-unit-testing/`

* `fixture.debugElement` // this will return all DOM element of the selected component

 beforeEach(`async`(() => {
    `TestBed.configureTestingModule`({
      `declarations`: [
        AppComponent
      ],
    }).`compileComponents`(); // it is use to compile all dependency component async.

    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent); // this will use to create component
  `debugElement = fixture.debugElement;`
   // this will return all DOM element use in that component And we will use that DOM element in testing.here `fixture` indicate `current component` and `debugElement` is use to file all `DOM element` use  in  that component.
  }));

it('should increment in template', () => {
    `debugElement` //it will return all DOM elemeent. Angular relies on the DebugElement abstraction to work safely across all supported platforms.
      .`query(By.css('button.increment'))` // it will use to select particular DOM element based on CSS property
      .`triggerEventHandler`(`'click', null`); // this will use to trigger event on selected element.

   ` fixture.detectChanges();` // it will use to detect change on each click on DOM element, means it is use to update DOM when event trigger because in case of test to update DOM we need to call this method.
    `const value = debugElement.query(By.css('h1'))``.nativeElement.innerText`;  //to check text of selected element
    expect(value).toEqual('1');
  });
it('should stop at 0 and show minimum message', () => {
    `debugElement`
      `.query(By.css('button.decrement'))`// it will use to select particular DOM element based on CSS property
      `.triggerEventHandler('click', null);`// this will use to trigger event on selected element.

`fixture.detectChanges();` // it will use to detect change on each click on DOM element
const message = debugElement.query(By.css('p.message'))`.nativeElement.innerText;` //to check text of selected element

` expect(message).toContain('Minimum');` // it will check to text contain in selected DOM elememnt.
  });


* `fixture.detectChanges()`-- Binding happens when Angular performs change detection.Means to check binding update first call `fixture.detectChanges()`.
In production, change detection kicks in automatically when Angular creates a component or the user enters a keystroke or an asynchronous activity (e.g., AJAX) completes.
The `TestBed.createComponent` does not trigger change detection. a fact confirmed in the revised test:

`fixture.detectChanges()`  will call after each `triggerEventHandler` to check changes on event fire on DOM element.We used `fixture.detectChanges` in Angular to run `change detection` before doing our assertions with Jasmine’s expect.
`.nativeElement.innerText` -- this will use when we need to check text of any seleced DOM `element.DebugElement` also  has a `nativeElement` method, `for direct access to the DOM.`
 `.triggerEventHandler('click', null);` -- this is use to fire event on seleceted DOM elemeent.
 and it has two argument , `first argument` contain name of event on selected DOM element.
 And second argument is optional and may be `null`.
`.query(By.css('button.decrement'))` -- Here we use the `By` utility and its `css method` to find a specific element in the template.

* `nativeElement:`--- 
`https://angular.io/guide/testing#component-dom-testing`
The value of `ComponentFixture.nativeElement` has the any type. Later you'll encounter the `DebugElement.nativeElement` and it too has the any type.
Angular can't know at compile time what kind of HTML element the nativeElement is or if it even is an HTML element. The app might be running on a non-browser platform, such as the server or a Web Worker, where the element may have a diminished API or not exist at all.

The tests in this guide are designed to run in a browser so a nativeElement value will always be an HTMLElement or one of its derived classes.

Here's another test that calls `HTMLElement.querySelector` to get the paragraph element and look for the banner text:

it('should have <p> with "banner works!"', () => {
  `const bannerElement: HTMLElement = fixture.nativeElement;`
  const p = `bannerElement.querySelector`('p');
  expect(p.textContent).toEqual('banner works!');
});

The Angular fixture provides the component's element directly through the `fixture.nativeElement`.
`const bannerElement: HTMLElement = fixture.nativeElement;`

The properties of the nativeElement depend upon the runtime environment. You could be running these tests on a non-browser platform that doesn't have a DOM or whose DOM-emulation doesn't support the full HTMLElement API.

`DebugElement:`---

Angular relies on the `DebugElement` abstraction to work safely across all supported platforms. Instead of creating an HTML element tree, Angular creates a `DebugElement tree` that wraps the `native elements` for the runtime platform. `The nativeElement property unwraps the DebugElement and returns the platform-specific element object.`

`const bannerDe: DebugElement = fixture.debugElement;`
`const bannerEl: HTMLElement = bannerDe.nativeElement;`

Here's the previous test, re-implemented with `fixture.debugElement.nativeElement`:

it('should find the <p> with fixture.debugElement.nativeElement)', () => {
 ` const bannerDe: DebugElement = fixture.debugElement;`
  `const bannerEl: HTMLElement = bannerDe.nativeElement;`
  const p = bannerEl.querySelector('p');
  expect(p.textContent).toEqual('banner works!');
});

* `The DebugElement has other methods and properties that are useful in tests,` 

You import the DebugElement symbol from the Angular core library.
`import { DebugElement } from '@angular/core';`

Although the tests in this guide all run in the browser, some apps might run on a different platform at least some of the time.

For example, the component might render first on the server as part of a strategy to make the application launch faster on poorly connected devices. The server-side renderer might not support the full HTML element API. `If it doesn't support querySelector, the previous test could fail.`

`The DebugElement offers query methods that work for all supported platforms.` These query methods take a predicate function that returns true when a node in the `DebugElement tree` matches the selection criteria.

You create a predicate with the help of a `By` class imported from a library for the runtime platform. Here's the `By` import for the browser platform:

`import { By } from '@angular/platform-browser';`

The following example re-implements the previous test with DebugElement.query() and the browser's By.css method.

it('should find the <p> with `fixture.debugElement.query`(By.css)', () => {
`  const bannerDe: DebugElement = fixture.debugElement;`// It will return all DOM element form current component
  const paragraphDe = bannerDe.query(By.css('p')); // this will return selected element based on query.
  `const p: HTMLElement = paragraphDe.nativeElement;`  `//You must unwrap that result to get the paragraph element.`
  expect(p.textContent).toEqual('banner works!');
});

`Some noteworthy observations:`

* The `By.css()` static method selects `DebugElement` nodes with a standard CSS selector.
* The `query` returns a `DebugElement` for the paragraph.
* You must unwrap that result to get the paragraph element. and we can do it by using `nativeElement`

When you're filtering by CSS selector and only testing properties of a browser's native element, the `By.css` approach may be overkill.

It's often easier and more clear to filter with a standard HTMLElement method such as querySelector() or querySelectorAll(), as you'll see in the next set of tests.

`Component Test Scenarios:`- https://angular.io/guide/testing#component-dom-testing
The current BannerComponent presents static title text in the HTML template.
After a few changes, the BannerComponent presents a dynamic title by binding to the component's title property like this.
@Component({
  selector: 'app-banner',
  template: '<h1>{{title}}</h1>',
  styles: ['h1 { color: green; font-size: 350%}']
})
export class BannerComponent {
  title = 'Test Tour of Heroes';
}

Simple as this is, you decide to add a test to confirm that component actually displays the right content where you think it should.

beforeEach(() => {
 ` TestBed.configureTestingModule`({
    `declarations`: [ BannerComponent ],
  });
  fixture = `TestBed.createComponent`(BannerComponent);
  component =` fixture.componentInstance;` // BannerComponent test instance
  h1 = `fixture.nativeElement.querySelector`('h1');
});

`Binding happens when Angular performs change detection.`

In production, change detection kicks in automatically when Angular creates a component or the user enters a keystroke or an asynchronous activity (e.g., AJAX) completes.

The `TestBed.createComponent` does not trigger change detection. a fact confirmed in the revised test:

`detectChanges():` You must tell the TestBed to perform data binding by calling `fixture.detectChanges()`. Only then does the <h1> have the expected title.

it('should display original title after detectChanges()', () => {
  `fixture.detectChanges();` // to update DOM element based on event trigger. // it will return all DOM elements
  expect(h1.textContent).toContain(component.title); 
});

Here's another test that changes the component's title property before calling `fixture.detectChanges()`.

it('should display a different test title', () => {
  component.title = 'Test Title';
  `fixture.detectChanges();`
  expect(h1.textContent).toContain('Test Title');
});

`Automatic change detection:` The BannerComponent tests frequently call detectChanges. Some testers prefer that the Angular test `environment run change detection automatically.`

That's possible by configuring the TestBed with the `ComponentFixtureAutoDetect` provider. First import it from the testing utility library:

`import { ComponentFixtureAutoDetect } from '@angular/core/testing';`

Then add it to the providers array of the testing module configuration:

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  declarations: [ BannerComponent ],
  providers: [
    { `provide: ComponentFixtureAutoDetect, useValue: true `}
  ]
});

`Here are three tests that illustrate how automatic change detection works.`

it('should display original title', () => {
  `// Hooray! No ``fixture.detectChanges()`` needed`
  expect(h1.textContent).toContain(comp.title);
});

it('should still see original title after comp.title change', () => {
  const oldTitle = comp.title;
  comp.title = 'Test Title';
  // Displayed title is old because Angular didn't hear the change :(
  expect(h1.textContent).toContain(oldTitle);
});

it('should display updated title after detectChanges', () => {
  comp.title = 'Test Title';
  `fixture.detectChanges(); // detect changes explicitly`
  expect(h1.textContent).toContain(comp.title);
});


`Change an input value with dispatchEvent():-`

Angular doesn't know that you set the input element's value property. It won't read that property until you raise the element's input event by calling dispatchEvent(). Then you call detectChanges().

The following example demonstrates the proper sequence.

it('should convert hero name to Title Case', () => {
  // get the name's input and display elements from the DOM
  `const hostElement = fixture.nativeElement;`
 ` const nameInput: HTMLInputElement = hostElement.querySelector('input');`
  `const nameDisplay: HTMLElement = hostElement.querySelector('span');`
 
  // simulate user entering a new name into the input box
  nameInput.value = 'quick BROWN  fOx';
 
  // dispatch a DOM event so that Angular learns of input value change.
  `nameInput.dispatchEvent(newEvent('input'));`
 
  // Tell Angular to update the display binding through the title pipe
 ` fixture.detectChanges();`
 
  expect(nameDisplay.textContent).toBe('Quick Brown  Fox');
});

* `dispatchEvent:-`

`Component with external files:`

The BannerComponent above is defined with an inline template and inline css, specified in the @Component.template and @Component.styles properties respectively.

Many components specify external templates and external css with the @Component.templateUrl and @Component.styleUrls properties respectively, as the following variant of BannerComponent does.

@Component({
  selector: 'app-banner',
  templateUrl: './banner-external.component.html',
  styleUrls:  ['./banner-external.component.css']
})
This syntax tells the Angular compiler to read the external files during component compilation.

You get this test failure message when the runtime environment compiles the source code during the tests themselves.

To correct the problem, call `compileComponents()` as explained below.

* `compileComponents():-` It is use to execute all dependency component asyc.

`Component with a dependency:` Components often have service dependencies.

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { UserService }       from '../model/user.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-welcome',
  template: '<h3 class="welcome"><i>{{welcome}}</i></h3>'
})
export class WelcomeComponent  implements OnInit {
  welcome: string;
  constructor(private userService: UserService) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.welcome = this.userService.isLoggedIn ?
      'Welcome, ' + this.userService.user.name : 'Please log in.';
  }
}
The WelcomeComponent has decision logic that interacts with the service, logic that makes this component worth testing. Here's the testing module configuration for the spec file, app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts:

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
   declarations: [ WelcomeComponent ],
// providers:    [ UserService ]  `// NO! Don't provide the real service!`
                                  `// only Provide a test-double instead`
   providers:    [ `{provide: UserService, useValue: userServiceStub }` ]
});

`Provide service test doubles:`
A component-under-test doesn't have to be injected with real services. In fact, it is usually better if they are test doubles (`stubs, fakes, spies, or mocks`). `The purpose of the spec is to test the component, not the service, and real services can be trouble.`

Injecting the real UserService could be a nightmare. The real service might ask the user for login credentials and attempt to reach an authentication server. These behaviors can be hard to intercept. It is far easier and safer to create and register a test double in place of the real UserService.

This particular test suite supplies a minimal mock of the UserService that satisfies the needs of the WelcomeComponent and its tests:

`let userServiceStub: Partial<UserService>;`
//Below is mock service which are use in place of original service.

`userServiceStub` = {
  isLoggedIn: true,
  user: { name: 'Test User'}
};

`Get injected services:-` The tests need access to the (stub) UserService injected into the WelcomeComponent.
The safest way to get the injected service, `the way that always works, is to get it from the injector of the component-under-test.`

// UserService actually injected into the component
`userService = fixture.debugElement.injector.get(UserService);`

`TestBed.get():`
You may also be able to get the service from the root injector via `TestBed.get()`. This is easier to remember and less verbose. But it only works when Angular injects the component with the service instance in the test's root injector.

// UserService from the root injector
`userService = TestBed.get(UserService);`

`Always get the service from an injector:-`

Final setup and tests: Here's the complete beforeEach(), using TestBed.get():
let userServiceStub: Partial<UserService>;

beforeEach(() => {
  `// stub UserService for test purposes`
  `userServiceStub` = {
    isLoggedIn: true,
    user: { name: 'Test User'}
  };

  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
     declarations: [ WelcomeComponent ],
     providers:    [ {`provide: UserService, useValue: userServiceStub` } ]
  });

  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(WelcomeComponent);
  comp    = fixture.componentInstance;

  // UserService from the root injector
 ` userService = TestBed.get(UserService);`

  //  get the "welcome" element by CSS selector (e.g., by class name)
  `el = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('.welcome');`
})


it('should welcome the user', () => {
 ` fixture.detectChanges();`
  const content = el.textContent;
  expect(content).toContain('Welcome', '"Welcome ..."');
  expect(content).toContain('Test User', 'expected name');
});

it('should welcome "Bubba"', () => {
  userService.user.name = 'Bubba'; // welcome message hasn't been shown yet
 ` fixture.detectChanges();`
  expect(el.textContent).toContain('Bubba');
});

it('should request login if not logged in', () => {
  userService.isLoggedIn = false; // welcome message hasn't been shown yet
  `fixture.detectChanges();`
  const content = el.textContent;
  expect(content).not.toContain('Welcome', 'not welcomed');
  expect(content).toMatch(/log in/i, '"log in"');
});

here are two ways to create a spy in Jasmine: 
https://www.htmlgoodies.com/html5/javascript/spy-on-javascript-methods-using-the-jasmine-testing-framework.html

spyOn() can only be used when the method already exists on the object, this is use when we need to check one function in service.
`//spyOn(object, methodName) where object.method() is a function`
 spyOn(obj, 'myMethod')
 let spy = spyOn(service, 'getValue').and.callThrough();

jasmine.createSpy() will return a brand new function: and if multiple function use in single service then we use this approach
`//jasmine.createSpy(stubName);`
var myMockMethod = jasmine.createSpy('My Method');

When testing a component, only the service's public API should matter. In general, tests themselves should not make calls to remote servers. They should emulate such calls. The setup in this app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts shows one way to do that:

// Create a fake TwainService object with a `getQuote()` spy
const twainServiceSpyObj = jasmine.createSpyObj('`TwainService`', ['`getQuote`']); 
// here `TwainService` is service name and `getQuote` is method name define in service and if there are multiple method in service then define as below and by using below approach we can create spyObj for multiple method in servie in a single line no need to create again again.and we can access each nmethod twainServiceSpyObj.method name.-->>

//const twainServiceSpyObj = jasmine.createSpyObj('`TwainService`', ['`getQuote`','`getQuote1`','`getQuote2`','`getQuote3`',]); 
// And we can access method like as below-->>
getQuoteSpy = twainServiceSpyObj.`getQuote`.and.`returnValue`( of(`testQuote`) ); //`testQuote` is responce from service 
getQuoteSpy = twainServiceSpyObj.`getQuote1`.and.`returnValue`( of(`testQuote1`) ); //`testQuote1` is responce from service 
getQuoteSpy = twainServiceSpyObj.`getQuote2`.and.`returnValue`( of(`testQuote2`) ); //`testQuote2` is responce from service 
getQuoteSpy = twainServiceSpyObj.`getQuote3`.and.`returnValue`( of(`testQuote3`) ); //`testQuote3` is responce from service 
getQuoteSpy = twainServiceSpyObj.`getQuote4`.and.`returnValue`( of(`testQuote4`) ); //`testQuote4` is responce from service 

// Make the spy return a synchronous Observable with the test data
getQuoteSpy = twainServiceSpyObj.`getQuote`.and.`returnValue`( of(`testQuote`) ); //`testQuote` is responce from service 

`The tick() function:-` You do have to call tick() to advance the (virtual) clock.

Calling `tick()` simulates the passage of time until all pending asynchronous activities finish. In this case, it waits for the error handler's setTimeout();The tick function is one of the Angular testing utilities that you import with TestBed. `It's a companion to fakeAsync and you can only call it within a fakeAsync body.`


`Async observab:-`  The real service sends requests to a remote server. A server takes time to respond and the response certainly won't be available immediately as in the previous two tests.Your tests will reflect the real world more faithfully if you return an asynchronous observable from the getQuote() spy like this.

// Simulate delayed observable values with the `asyncData()` helper
getQuoteSpy.and.returnValue(asyncData(testQuote));

The async observable was produced by an asyncData helper The asyncData helper is a utility function that you'll have to write yourself. Or you can copy this one from the sample code. Use betow code-

/** Create async observable that emits-once and completes
 *  after a JS engine turn */
export function asyncData<T>(data: T) {
  return defer(() => Promise.resolve(data));
}

There's a similar helper for producing an async error.

/** Create async observable error that errors
 *  after a JS engine turn */
export function asyncError<T>(errorObject: any) {
  return defer(() => Promise.reject(errorObject));
}


`Async test with async()`:

it('should show quote after getQuote (async)', `async(()` => {
  fixture.detectChanges(); // ngOnInit()
  expect(quoteEl.textContent).toBe('...', 'should show placeholder');

  `fixture.whenStable().`then(() => { // wait for async getQuote
    `fixture.detectChanges(); `     // update view with quote
    expect(quoteEl.textContent).toBe(testQuote);
    expect(errorMessage()).toBeNull('should not show error');
  });
}));
 You don't have to pass Jasmine's `done()` into the test and call done() in promise or observable callbacks.
 But the test's asynchronous nature is revealed by the call to `fixture.whenStable()`, which breaks the linear flow of control.

`whenStable:` The test must wait for the getQuote() observable to emit the next quote. Instead of calling tick(), it calls `fixture.whenStable()`.
The test resumes within the promise callback, which calls `detectChanges()` to update the quote element with the expected text.

`Jasmine done()` Writing test functions with done(), is more cumbersome than asyncand fakeAsync. But it is occasionally necessary. For example, you can't call async or fakeAsync when testing code that involves the intervalTimer() or the RxJS delay() operator.

`Component with inputs and outputs:` A component with inputs and outputs typically appears inside the view template of a host component. The host uses a property binding to set the input property and an event binding to listen to events raised by the output property.

The testing goal is to verify that such bindings work as expected. The tests should set input values and listen for output events.

@Component({
  selector: 'dashboard-hero',
  template: `
    <div (click)="click()" class="hero">
      {{hero.name | uppercase}}
    </div>`,
  styleUrls: [ './dashboard-hero.component.css' ]
})
export class DashboardHeroComponent {
  @Input() hero: Hero;
  @Output() selected = new EventEmitter<Hero>();
  click() { this.selected.emit(this.hero); }
}
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  declarations: [ `DashboardHeroComponent` ]
})
fixture = `TestBed.createComponent`(DashboardHeroComponent);
comp    = `fixture.componentInstance`;

// find the hero's DebugElement and element
`heroDe  = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('.hero'));`
heroEl = heroDe.nativeElement;

// mock the hero supplied by the parent component
expectedHero = { id: 42, name: 'Test Name' };

// simulate the parent setting the input property with that hero
comp.hero = expectedHero;

// trigger initial data binding
`fixture.detectChanges();`
`Clicking()`-
it('should raise selected event when clicked (triggerEventHandler)', () => {
  let selectedHero: Hero;
  comp.selected.subscribe((hero: Hero) => selectedHero = hero);

 ` heroDe.triggerEventHandler('click', null);`  // this will apply click event on selected div element.
  expect(selectedHero).toBe(expectedHero); // this will responce after trigger event
});

`triggerEventHandler():`
The `heroDe` in the previous test is a DebugElement that represents the hero <div>.It has Angular properties and methods that abstract interaction with the native element. This test calls the DebugElement.triggerEventHandler with the "click" event name.

The Angular `DebugElement.triggerEventHandler` can raise any `data-bound event by its event name`. The `second parameter is the event object passed to the handler.`

 `el.triggerEventHandler('click', eventObj);`
The test triggered a "click" event with a null event object.

`heroDe.triggerEventHandler('click', null);`
The test assumes (correctly in this case) that the runtime event handler—the component's click() method—doesn't care about the event object.

`Component inside a test host:`

`Routing component:`
A routing component is a component that tells the Router to navigate to another component. The `DashboardComponent` is a routing component because the user can navigate to the `HeroDetailComponent` by clicking on one of the hero buttons on the dashboard.

`Routed components:` A routed component is the destination of a Router navigation. It can be trickier to test, especially when the route to the component includes parameters. The `HeroDetailComponent` is a routed component that is the destination of such a route.

The Router matches that URL to a route to the HeroDetailComponent. It creates an ActivatedRoute object with the routing information and injects it into a new instance of the HeroDetailComponent.

The HeroDetail component needs the id parameter so it can fetch the corresponding hero via the HeroDetailService. The component has to get the id from the ActivatedRoute.paramMap property which is an Observable.

`Nested component tests:`
Component templates often have nested components, whose templates may contain more components.
The component tree can be very deep and, most of the time, the nested components play no role in testing the component at the top of the tree.

The AppComponent, for example, displays a navigation bar with anchors and their RouterLink directives.

`app/app.component.html`
<app-banner></app-banner>
<app-welcome></app-welcome>
<nav>
  <a routerLink="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>
  <a routerLink="/heroes">Heroes</a>
  <a routerLink="/about">About</a>
</nav>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>

To validate the links, you don't need the Router to navigate and you don't need the <router-outlet> to mark where the Router inserts routed components.
The BannerComponent and WelcomeComponent (indicated by <app-banner> and <app-welcome>) are also irrelevant.

app/app.component.spec.ts (TestBed stubs):

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    RouterLinkDirectiveStub,
    BannerStubComponent,
    RouterOutletStubComponent,
    WelcomeStubComponent
  ]
})


`NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA :`

In the second approach, add `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` to the `TestBed.schemas` metadata.

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    RouterLinkDirectiveStub
  ],
 ` schemas: [ NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA ]`
})

app/app.component.spec.ts (NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA):

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    RouterLinkDirectiveStub
  ],
`  schemas: [ NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA ]`
})

`The NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA tells the Angular compiler to ignore unrecognized elements and attributes.`

The compiler will recognize the <app-root> element and the routerLink attribute because you declared a corresponding AppComponent and RouterLinkDirectiveStub in the TestBed configuration.

But the compiler won't throw an error when it encounters <app-banner>, <app-welcome>, or <router-outlet>. It simply renders them as empty tags and the browser ignores them.

The `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` also prevents the compiler from telling you about the missing components and attributes that you omitted inadvertently or misspelled. You could waste hours chasing phantom bugs that the compiler would have caught in an instant.

`Use both techniques together:`
In practice you will combine the two techniques in the same setup, as seen in this example.

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    BannerStubComponent,
    RouterLinkDirectiveStub
  ],
  `schemas: [ NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA ]`
})

The Angular compiler creates the BannerComponentStub for the <app-banner> element and applies the RouterLinkStubDirective to the anchors with the routerLink attribute, but it ignores the <app-welcome> and <router-outlet> tags.

`Components with RouterLink:`

`Use a page object:`

`Attribute Directive Testing:-`
An attribute directive modifies the behavior of an element, component or another directive. Its name reflects the way the directive is applied: as an attribute on a host element.

The sample application's HighlightDirective sets the background color of an element based on either a data bound color or a default color (lightgray).  It also sets a custom property of the element (customProperty) to true for no reason other than to show that it can.

import { Directive, ElementRef, Input, OnChanges } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({ selector: '[highlight]' })
/** Set backgroundColor for the attached element to highlight color
 *  and set the element's customProperty to true */
export class HighlightDirective implements OnChanges {

  defaultColor =  'rgb(211, 211, 211)'; // lightgray

  @Input('highlight') bgColor: string;

  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {
    el.nativeElement.style.customProperty = true;
  }

  ngOnChanges() {
    this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = this.bgColor || this.defaultColor;
  }
}


import { Component } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  template: `
  <h2 highlight="skyblue">About</h2>
  <h3>Quote of the day:</h3>
  <twain-quote></twain-quote>
  `
})
export class AboutComponent { }

beforeEach(() => {
  fixture = TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [ AboutComponent, HighlightDirective],
   ` schemas:`      [ `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` ]
  })
  .createComponent(AboutComponent);
  fixture.detectChanges(); // initial binding
});

it('should have skyblue <h2>', () => {
 ` const h2: HTMLElement = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('h2');`
  `const bgColor = h2.style.backgroundColor;`
  expect(bgColor).toBe('skyblue');
});

@Component({
  template: `
  <h2 highlight="yellow">Something Yellow</h2>
  <h2 highlight>The Default (Gray)</h2>
  <h2>No Highlight</h2>
  <input #box [highlight]="box.value" value="cyan"/>`
})
class TestComponent { }

Here are some tests of this component:

`Pipe Testing:`- A pipe class has one method, transform, that manipulates the input value into a transformed output value. The transform implementation rarely interacts with the DOM. Most pipes have no dependence on Angular other than the @Pipe metadata and an interface.

import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({name: 'titlecase', pure: true})
/** Transform to Title Case: uppercase the first letter of the words in a string.*/
export class TitleCasePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(input: string): string {
    return input.length === 0 ? '' :
      input.replace(/\w\S*/g, (txt => txt[0].toUpperCase() + txt.substr(1).toLowerCase() ));
  }
}

describe('TitleCasePipe', () => {
  // This pipe is a pure, stateless function so no need for BeforeEach
  let pipe = new TitleCasePipe();
 
  it('transforms "abc" to "Abc"', () => {
    expect(pipe.transform('abc')).toBe('Abc');
  });
 
  it('transforms "abc def" to "Abc Def"', () => {
    expect(pipe.transform('abc def')).toBe('Abc Def');
  });
 
  // ... more tests ...
});

`Write DOM tests too:-`

`Test debugging:-` Debug specs in the browser in the same way that you debug an application.

1- Reveal the karma browser window (hidden earlier).
2- Click the DEBUG button; it opens a new browser tab and re-runs the tests.
3- Open the browser's “Developer Tools” (Ctrl-Shift-I on windows; Command-Option-I in OSX).
4- Pick the "sources" section.
5- Open the 1st.spec.ts test file (Control/Command-P, then start typing the name of the file).
6- Set a breakpoint in the test.
7- Refresh the browser, and it stops at the breakpoint.


`TestBed class summary:-`

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    BannerStubComponent,
    RouterLinkDirectiveStub
  ],
  schemas: [ NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA ]
})

The module definition passed to configureTestingModule is a subset of the @NgModule metadata properties.
type TestModuleMetadata = {
  providers?: any[];
  declarations?: any[];
  imports?: any[];
  schemas?: Array<SchemaMetadata | any[]>;
};

beforeEach(async(() => {
      `  TestBed.configureTestingModule`({
            `declarations`: [MainBoxComponent, LeftBoxComponent, RightBoxComponent], //declare all dependency componrnt,directive, filters(pipes),
            `providers`: [
                { provide: StudentService, useClass: StudentServiceMock },
                { provide: ElementRef, useClass: MockElementRef },
                SharedServiceService
            ],
            `imports`: [RouterTestingModule, FormsModule]
        })
            .`compileComponents`();// Compile the testing module asynchronously after you've finished configuring it.
        console.log('test bed configuration for MainBoxComponent complete.');
    }));
    beforeEach(() => {
        fixture = TestBed.`createComponent`(MainBoxComponent);
        component = fixture.`componentInstance`; // Create an instance of a component for which we need to write test case.

        console.log(fixture);
        fixture.detectChanges();
        console.log('Fixture configuration for MainBoxComponent complete.');
    });

`configureTestingModule:` The testing shims (`karma-test-shim, browser-test-shim`) establish the initial test environment and a default testing module. The default testing module is configured with basic declaratives and some Angular service substitutes that every tester needs.

Call configureTestingModule to refine the testing module configuration for a particular set of tests by adding and removing `imports`, `declarations` (of `components`, `directives`, and `pipes`), and `providers`(services,and mock services).

`compileComponents:` Compile the testing module asynchronously after you've finished configuring it.You must call this method if any of the testing module components have a templateUrl or styleUrls because fetching component template and style files is necessarily asynchronous.

`createComponent:` Create an instance of a component for which we need to write test case.

`The ComponentFixture:` The TestBed.createComponent<T> creates an instance of the component T and returns a strongly typed ComponentFixture for that component.

`The ComponentFixture properties and methods provide access to the component, its DOM representation, and aspects of its Angular environment.`

 `let fixture: ComponentFixture<MainBoxComponent>;`

`fixture = TestBed.createComponent(DashboardHeroComponent);`

`ComponentFixture properties:` Here are the most important properties for testers, in order of likely utility.
fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MainBoxComponent);
component = `fixture.componentInstance;`

* `componentInstance	:`
The instance of the component class created by `TestBed.createComponent`

* `debugElement :`
The DebugElement associated with the root element of the component and use to fine all DOM element use in component.

The debugElement provides insight into the component and its DOM element during test and debugging. It's a critical property for testers. 

* `nativeElement :`
The native DOM element at the root of the component.it s use to access DOM elements in component.

`ComponentFixture methods:`
The fixture methods cause Angular to perform certain tasks on the component tree. Call these method to trigger Angular behavior in response to simulated user action.

* `detectChanges :`
Trigger a change detection cycle for the component.Call it to initialize the component (it calls ngOnInit) and after your test code, change the component's data bound property values. Angular can't see that you've changed personComponent.name and w`on't update the name binding until you call detectChanges.`

`DebugElement :`
The DebugElement provides crucial insights into the component's DOM representation.Here are the most useful DebugElement members for testers, in approximate order of utility:

* `nativeElement :` The corresponding DOM element in the browser (null for WebWorkers).

* `query :`  it is use to fnd element based on query.Calling query(predicate: Predicate<DebugElement>)` returns the first DebugElement that matches the predicate at any depth in the subtree.`
// Can find DebugElement either by css selector or by directive
const h2        = `fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('h2'));`
const directive = `fixture.debugElement.query(By.directive(HighlightDirective));`

* `queryAll :`   Calling queryAll(predicate: Predicate<DebugElement>) `returns all DebugElements that matches the predicate at any depth in subtree.`
// Filter for DebugElements with a #content reference
const contentRefs = el.queryAll( de => de.references['content']);

* `triggerEventHandler :` Triggers the event by its name if there is a corresponding listener in the element's listeners collection. The second parameter is the event object expected by the handler.
`heroDe.triggerEventHandler('click', null);`

The Angular `DebugElement.triggerEventHandler` can raise any data-bound event by its event name. The second parameter is the event object passed to the handler.

The `DebugElement.query(predicate)` and DebugElement.queryAll(predicate) methods take a predicate that filters the source element's subtree for matching DebugElement.

The Angular By class has three static methods for common predicates:
* `By.all` - return all elements.
* `By.css(selector`) - return elements with matching CSS selectors.
* `By.directive(directive)` - return elements that Angular matched to an instance of the directive class.

// Can find DebugElement either by css selector or by directive
const h2        = fixture.debugElement.query(`By.css`('h2'));
const directive = fixture.debugElement.query(`By.directive`(HighlightDirective));

### difference between switchMap and flatMap

`https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/handout/http/search_with_switchmap.html`

Consider a situation where we first type in the letters ABC, and suppose the string ABC is actually a 
special string where it will take the server a few extra seconds to reply.
Meanwhile, after we paused for a bit (more than the debounce time), 
we decide to type in another letter (the letter X) and our app sends a request to the server for the string ABCX. 
Since ABCX is not considered a special string, the server replies very quickly and our app sets the suggestions for ABCX.
A few seconds later, however, the server finally replies with the response for the ABC string, 
and our app receives that response and sets the search suggestions for ABC, overwriting the suggestions for the ABCX string, 
even though the request for that actually came afterwards.
Here is a simple diagram to illustrate the issue:

// A1: Request for `ABC`

// A2: Response for `ABC`

// B1: Request for `ABCX`

// B2: Response for `ABCX`

--A1----------A2-->

------B1--B2------>

You can see that A2 arrives after B2 even though the A1 request began first. This will end up showing the
wrong results to the user. "If the last input in the search was ABCX why am I seeing the results for ABC?" 
the user might think. To get around this problem we need to replace flatMap with switchMap.
What is switchMap?
switchMap is very similar to flatMap, but with a very important distinction. Any events to be merged into the 
trunk stream are ignored if a new event comes in. Here is a marble diagram showing the behavior of switchMap:

In short, every time an event comes down the stream, flatMap will subscribe to (and invoke) a new observable 
without unsubscribing from any other observable created by a previous event. 
switchMap on the other hand will automatically unsubscribe from any previous observable when a new event comes down the stream.

If we apply switchMap to the above example, the response for ABC would be ignored and the suggestions for ABCX would remain.

Below is a simple Angular 2 app with a real time search to the cdnjs public API. Type-in and see the real time magic:

It uses the power of observables and the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS). We’re using a few operators, namely debounceTime, 
distinctUntilChanged and switchMap to make sure we don’t send too many API calls and that we get only the results from the latest request. Let’s break it down in three parts:

###  Create routing guard|interface|enum|module` --- need to implement
[`https://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-4-route-guards-canactivate-and-canactivatechild-example`]
[`https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-guard`]
[`https://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-4-child-routes-and-relative-navigation-example`]

## To create the routing gaurd follow the following line- 
* `ng generate guard routingGuard`

1. `CanActivate -:` CanActivate is an Angular interface. It is used to force user to login into application before navigating to the route.

canActivate(next: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): boolean {
if (this.localStorageService.getLocalStorageData('claims') == null) {
	alert('Activation blocked');
	this.router.navigate(['./login']);
	return false; /** It means not open next url move to only login page */
}
return true;  /** It means move to next URL */
}
canActivate() which has following arguments.->>

`1-: ActivatedRouteSnapshot:` 
`2-: RouterStateSnapshot:`

2. `CanActivateChild:-` CanActivateChild is an Angular interface to guard child routes. Suppose a user has been `authenticated` but not `authorized` to visit the child routes,so child routes can be guarded using CanActivateChild. 

const countryRoutes: Routes = [
{
path: 'country',
component: CountryComponent,
canActivate: [ AuthGuardService ],
children: [
{
path: '',
canActivateChild: [ AuthGuardService ],
children: [
		{ path: 'view', component: CountryDetailComponent },
		{ path: 'add', component: AddCountryComponent }
	]
	}
]
}
]; 

## DIFFERENCE BETWEEN `authenticated` AND `authorized`. :
`authenticated:` It means user need to login befor open any other page

`authorized:` It means user is now able to open other page after login but not open any particular link because that user is not authorized for that link.

3. `CanDeactivate:-` Implementing `CanDeactivate` can be a bit trickier than CanActivate, CanActivateChild,The trick to 
CanDeactivate is that we need to make it reusable for multiple components. To do this,we'll create a guard that checks a component to see if it has a canDeactivate() method.CanDeactivate interface is a route guard to decide if a route can deactivated.

The canDeactivate guard is different from the rest. Its main purpose is not to check permissions, but to ask for confirmation.

It means it use to check for confirmation that need to save any changes or not if we click on 'YEs' then save changes other wise discard changes.

[`https://www.packtpub.com/mapt/book/application_development/9781787288904/9/ch09lvl1sec52/candeactivate`]

[
{
path: 'compose',
component: ComposeCmp,
`canDeactivate: [SaveChangesGuard]`
outlet: 'popup'
}
]

`Where SaveChangesGuard is defined as follows:`

`class SaveChangesGuard implements CanDeactivate<ComposeCmp>` {
constructor(private dialogs: Dialogs) {}

canDeactivate(component: ComposeCmp, route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
			state: RouterStateSnapshot): Promise<boolean> {
if (component.unsavedChanges) {
return this.dialogs.unsavedChangesConfirmationDialog();
} else {
return Promise.resolve(true);
}
}
}

The `SaveChangesGuard` class asks the user to confirm the navigation because all the unsaved changes would be lost. If she confirms, the unsavedChangesConfirmationDialog will return false, and the navigation will be...
This page will walk through Angular 2/4 route guards `CanActivate` and `CanActivateChild` example.
In the Angular application in which authentication and authorization is required to navigate a route,
the role of Angular route guard comes into the picture. There are many API of route guards but in this article 
we will discuss CanActivate and `CanActivateChild`. Both API works in the same way. 
`CanActivate` and `CanActivateChild` are interfaces and have methods `canActivate()` and `canActivateChild()` respectively.
These methods return Boolean value. `CanActivate` is used for authentication and `CanActivateChild` is used for authorization.
To use route guards in our application, we need to create a service and implement these interfaces and define their methods. 
Angular Route interface provides `canActivate` and `canActivateChild` properties to configure service class 
which is implementing `CanActivate` and `CanActivateChild` interfaces. 

## Do you need a Routing Module? Why/not?: https://github.com/Yonet/Angular-Interview-Questions/blob/master/router.md

## When does a lazy loaded module is loaded?:

## When to use forRoot in Angular?:
https://www.freelancermap.com/freelancer-tips/12255-forroot-forchild-angular

`ForRoot` is used when a module is "eager," that is, it is not lazy-loaded (loads when the application starts). 
 Angular creates a factory for all the modules, except for the lazy modules, which when loaded on demand, have their own factory.

 ## When to use forChild in Angular? 
`ForChild` is used the other way around: specifically when we want to deliver a provider that is visible only to the "children" modules of our module, in case they are lazy loaded. As each lazy module is loaded on demand, it has its own injector.

## Can you explain the difference between ActivatedRoute and RouterState?

After the end of each successful navigation lifecycle, the router builds a tree of ActivatedRoute objects that make up the current state of the router. We can access the current RouterState from anywhere in our application using the Router service and the routerState property.

RouterState is the current state of the router including a tree of the currently activated routes in our application along convenience methods for traversing the route tree.

So we can say that:
1- ActivatedRoute (check in `student-update component` file)is object
2- RouterState (return current statre.)is property name inside the ActivatedRoute object .

## lazy loaded concept : 
``https://github.com/Yonet/Angular-Interview-Questions/blob/master/router.md``
How does loadChildren property work?
const routes: Routes = [
  ...,
  { path: 'edit', `loadChildren`: 'app/edit/edit.module#EditModule' },
  ...
]

* In the above example, `loadChildren` tells the router to fetch the EditModule bundle assigned to it when the user visits '/edit' url. (To be more precise, it will ask the module loader to find and load it.)
* Router will get the router configuration from edit module.It means we will define rout inside the `EditModule`  (also check login.module.ts in login.modile folder to clear concept of module and  module with routing)
* 

`loadChildren:` Reference to lazy loaded child routes. 
const routes: Routes = [
{
path: 'country',
loadChildren: 'app/country/country.module#CountryModule'
},
{
path: 'person',
	loadChildren: 'app/person/person.module#PersonModule'
}
]; 

`NOTE-:` Notice that the lazy loading syntax uses `loadChildren` followed by a string that is the path to the module, a hash mark or #, and the module’s class name.

`Benefit of lazy loaded-:`

1- Another advantage of using modules to group related pieces of functionality of our application is the ability to load those pieces on demand.

It means load module only when we click on link to load any particular module.

2- Lazy loading modules helps us decrease the startup time.it means at the time when page is load at first time the only load main page with module which are 
required and rest all page and module which are not required will be load on demand when required.

3- With lazy loading our application does not need to load everything at once, it only needs to load what the user expects to see when the app first loads. 
Modules that are lazily loaded will only be loaded when the user navigates to their routes.

4- Lazy loading is a technique in Angular that allows you to load JavaScript components asynchronously when a specific route is activated.

 [`https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/handout/modules/lazy-loading-module.html`]

const routes: Routes = [
{ path: '', redirectTo: 'eager', pathMatch: 'full' }, // this will load when page is load first time  and this is not concept of lazy loading
{ path: 'eager', component: EagerComponent }, // this will load when page is load first time  and this is not concept of lazy loading
{ path: 'lazy', loadChildren: 'lazy/lazy.module#LazyModule' }  // this will on demand  and this is concept of lazy loading
];

`Look closely at the definition of that route:`

{ path: 'lazy', loadChildren: 'lazy/lazy.module#LazyModule' }
There's a few important things to notice here:

`1- We use the property loadChildren instead of component.`
`2- We pass a string instead of a symbol to avoid loading the module eagerly.`
`3- We define not only the path to the module but the name of the class as well.`

`export const routing: ModuleWithProviders = RouterModule.forChild(routes); // it use for those when we need to load feature module just as lazyloading`

Notice that we use the method call `forChild()` instead of `forRoot()` to create the routing object. We should always do that when creating a routing object for a feature module, feature module means module which load in feature on demands.no matter if the module is supposed to be eagerly or lazily loaded.

`Drawback of lazy loaded-:`  [`https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules`]

`Confirm it’s working for lazyloading -:` You can check to see that a module is indeed being lazy loaded with the Chrome developer tools. 
In Chrome, open the dev tools by pressing `Cmd+Option+i`

Another option we can check it inside the minified code in Source tab suppose we use `lazy loading` in userModule then userModule is not load in `main js file`
if we will not click on USER link if we click on user link after that userModule will load into main js file.

## Difference in forRoot() and forChild() :

[`https://github.com/Yonet/Angular-Interview-Questions/blob/master/router.md`]
[`https://toddmotto.com/angular-component-routers`]   (check it)
[`https://damienbod.com/2016/03/29/angular-2-child-routing-and-components/`]  (check it)

`1-:- forRoot` creates a module that contains all the directives, the given routes, and the router service itself.

`2-:- forChild` creates a module that contains all the directives and the given routes, but does not include the router service. 

It registers the routers and uses the router service created at the root level.

`RouterModule.forChild` is quite similar to the forRoot method, however is likely to be used with something like a 
feature module - rather than our main (root) module. means use `RouterModule.forChild` with that module which are load on demand.it is use to load 
`feature module like as lazyloading module.`

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { LazyloadingComponent } from './lazyloading.component';
import { LazyloadingfirstchildComponent } from '../lazyloadingfirstchild/lazyloadingfirstchild.component';
import { LazyloadingsecondchildComponent } from '../lazyloadingsecondchild/lazyloadingsecondchild.component';

const routes: Routes = [
{ path: '',  component: LazyloadingComponent,
children: [
{path: 'lazyloadingfirstChild', component:  LazyloadingfirstchildComponent}, 
{path: 'lazyloadingsecondChild', component: LazyloadingsecondchildComponent}, 
]   },
];
@NgModule({
imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)], // this is use in case of Lazyloading concept
exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class LazyloadingRoutingModule { }

## Lazy-loading content with angular-cli -:

So the component which are lazy load then first we have to create lazyloading-routing module and lazyloading-module which contain the information about lazyloading component.

`difference between ActivatedRoute and RouterState? :-`
[`https://github.com/Yonet/Angular-Interview-Questions/blob/master/router.md`]

`Properties of Angular Routes Array -:`
Routes is an array of Angular Route interface. Route is used to define a path. Find the properties of Route interface.
1-` path:` Defines path for a component. 
2- `component:` Name of the component. 
3- `outlet:` Name of the outlet component should be placed into. 
4- `data:` Additional data provided to component via ActivatedRoute. 
5- `children:` Array of child route definitions. 
6- `loadChildren:` Reference to lazy loaded child routes. 
7- `redirectTo:` Defines a URL to redirect current matched URL.

`Lazy-loading content with angular-cli-:`

	/** TO check current rout path */
		console.log('activatedRoute.snapshot.routeConfig.path', activatedRoute.snapshot);

			}

### If we want to higlight column value based i=on condition then --  student-details.component.ts

checkForChanges () {
        if (this.tableDataQty && this.tableData) {
            if (this.tableDataQty.length == this.tableData.length) {

###  find height of box container and code is in component.:- //main-box.component.ts

And based on height we set this height to all other box.
/**

   */
  @ViewChild('mainBox') elementView: ElementRef;
  viewHeight: number;
  viewHeightArray=[];

  /**

### data sharing concept into parent-child,child-parent, and sub child    // Check main-box,left-box componetnt

1-: `data sharing concept into parent to child-:`
[`https://www.infragistics.com/community/blogs/b/dhananjay_kumar/posts/communication-between-components-using-input-in-angular-2`]

`In Parent.html-` This is HTMl page where another component(call as child component) include inside it.

<app-child [title]='childTitle'></app-child> 

`In Parent.component.ts-:`

childTitle:string = 'This text is passed to child';

`In child.html-:`

<h2>{{title}}</h2>

`In Child.component.ts-:`

@Input() title:string;	 // Check main-box,left-box componetnt

`Usage of @Input decorator: @Input decorator is used to define the property which receives the data from the parent property.`

## Sharing method from parent to child component -
We may have a requirement to intercept data passed from the parent component inside the child component.
This can be done using getter and setter on the input property.

`Usage of inputs array: inside @Component.`

@Component({
selector: 'user',
inputs: ['value']
})

2-:`data sharing concept into child to parent -:` // Check main-box,left-box componetnt

[`https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/sharing-data-between-angular-components-four-methods/`]

`In Child.component.ts-:`

`In the child, we declare a messageEvent variable with the Output decorator and set it equal to a new event emitter.`

`@Output() notify:` EventEmitter<string> = new EventEmitter<string>(); `// notify is the custom event here and EventEmitter is use to create custom event`

message1: string = "Hola Mundo!"

onClick() {  /**onClick() will call when we click on button in child page anf set some data with notify event*/
this.notify.emit(this.message1); // emit notify event	
}

`In Parent.component.ts-`  // Check main-box,left-box componetnt

onNotify(message:string):void { /** onNotify() is method which is call with notify event */
this.parentTitle=message;
}

`In Parent.html-:`

<app-child (notify)='onNotify($event)'></app-child> 
<h2>Name: {{parentTitle}}</h2>

### NOTE- If Any thing we want to shafre between parent child component then we have to use @output and @input
And if we want to send method from child to parent then we need to create servie
but if we want to send object or any data then we can use @Output concept.

## Parent to Child: Sharing Data via Input:   // Check main-box,left-box componetnt[`https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/sharing-data-between-angular-components-four-methods/`]


## Child to Parent: Sharing Data via ViewChild: // Check main-box,left-box componetnt
[`https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/sharing-data-between-angular-components-four-methods/`]

`ViewChild` allows a one component to be injected into another, giving the parent access to its `attributes and functions`. One caveat, however, is that child won’t be available until after the view has been initialized. This means we need to implement the `AfterViewInit lifecycle hook to receive the data from the child`.

### Child to Parent: Sharing Data via Output() and EventEmitter:  // Check main-box,left-box componetnt
[`https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/sharing-data-between-angular-components-four-methods/`]
Another way to share data is to emit data from the child, which can be listed to by the parent. This approach is ideal when you want to share data changes that occur on things like button clicks, form entires, and other user events.
In the parent, we create a function to receive the message and set it equal to the message variable.

## parent.component.ts:-
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  template: `
    Message: {{message}}
    <app-child (messageEvent)="receiveMessage($event)"></app-child>
  `,
  styleUrls: ['./parent.component.css']
})
export class ParentComponent {
  constructor() { }
  message:string;
  receiveMessage($event) {
    this.message = $event
  }
}
## child.component.ts:-
import { Component, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `
      <button (click)="sendMessage()">Send Message</button>
  `,
  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css']
})
export class ChildComponent {
  message: string = "Hola Mundo!"
  @Output() messageEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();
  constructor() { }
  sendMessage() {
    this.messageEvent.emit(this.message);
  }
}
### Unrelated Components: Sharing Data with a Service:- // Check main-box,left-box componetnt
[`https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/sharing-data-between-angular-components-four-methods/`]

When passing data between components that lack a direct connection, such as siblings, grandchildren, etc, you should you a shared service. When you have data that should aways been in sync, I find the `RxJS BehaviorSubject` very useful in this situation.

You can also use a regular `RxJS Subject` for sharing data via the service, but here’s why I prefer a `BehaviorSubject`.

1-: It will always return the current value on subscription - there is no need to call on next
2-: It has a getValue() function to extract the last value as raw data. // we can also get previous value
3-: It ensures that the component always receives the most recent data.
4- if we subscribe it then it set initial value but in case of subject not return initial value when we subscribe it to get value in

`subject on subscribe first we need to set value in subject.`

`The unique features of a behavior subject are:`

1- Behavior subject needs an initial value as it must always return a value on subscription even if it hasn’t received a next()
2- In addition you can get a observable from behavior subject using the asobservable() method on behaviour subject.

`NOTE- In addition you can get a observable from behavior subject using the asobservable() method on behaviour subject.`

`RxJS Subject` and  `RxJS BehaviorSubject` both are same in functionalities only difference is that when we need to set initial vlaue 


when page is load then in that case we need to use `RxJS BehaviorSubject`.
And when we need there is no initial value set when page is load then in that case we need to use `RxJS Subject`.
	  
/**
* It is an object with the methods next(v), error(e), and complete(). 
* To feed a new value to the Subject, just call next(theValue)
*/
`Observable.subscribe() -:` The observable subscribe method is used to subscribe to messages that are sent to an observable.
ngOnInit() {  
    this.sharedServiceService.currentMessage.subscribe(message => this.shardeDatamessage = message)
  }
`Subject.next()-:` The subject next method is used to send messages to an observable which are then sent to all subscribers of that observable.

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';
@Injectable()
export class SharedServiceService {
  private messageSource = new BehaviorSubject('default message');
  currentMessage = this.messageSource.asObservable();
  constructor() { }
  changeMessage(message: string) {
    this.messageSource.next(message)
  }
}

## Why we use asObservable():-
	
## where we can use BehaviorSubject, Subject in directive ,component, service ?

## DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BEHAVIOR SUBJECT AND AN OBSERVABLE ?


[`https://hassantariqblog.wordpress.com/2016/12/03/angular2-difference-between-a-behavior-subject-and-an-observable/`]

An observable can be created from both Regular and Behavior Subjects using `subject.asobservable()`. 
Only difference being you can’t send values to a observable using next() method.

In angular2 services, I would use behavior subject for a data service as a angular service often initializes before component and behavior subject ensures that the component consuming the service receives the last updated data even if there are no new updates since the component’s subscription to this data”

## Communicating Between Components with Observable & Subject ?

[`http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2016/12/01/angular-2-communicating-between-components-with-observable-subject`]

`Observable.subscribe()-:` The observable subscribe method is used to subscribe to messages that are sent to an observable.

`Subject.next()-:` The subject next method is used to send messages to an observable which are then sent to all subscribers of that observable.

`Angular 2/5 Message Service.TS`

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { Subject } from 'rxjs/Subject';

@Injectable()
export class MessageService {
private subject = new Subject<any>(); // Use subject inside the service to get the latest value which are receive from component

sendMessage(message: string) {
	this.subject.next({ text: message }); // it will contain latest value which are receive from component
}
clearMessage() {
	this.subject.next();
}

getMessage(): Observable<any> {
	return this.subject.asObservable();  // TO USE SUBJECT DATA USING SubscribE FIRST WE NEED TO CONVERT IT INTO OBSERABLE.
}
}

`Angular 2/5 App Component that Receives Messages`

The app component uses the message service to subscribe to new messages and make them available to the app component template via the message property.

import { Component, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
import { Subscription } from 'rxjs/Subscription';
import { MessageService } from './_services/index';

@Component({
moduleId: module.id,
selector: 'app',
templateUrl: 'app.component.html'
})

export class AppComponent implements OnDestroy {
message: any;
subscription: Subscription;

constructor(private messageService: MessageService) {
	// subscribe to home component messages
	this.subscription = this.messageService.getMessage().subscribe(message => { this.message = message; });
}

ngOnDestroy() {
	// unsubscribe to ensure no memory leaks
	this.subscription.unsubscribe();
}
}

`Angular 2/5 Home Component that Sends Messages`

The home component uses the message service to send messages to the app component.

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { MessageService } from '../_services/index';

@Component({
moduleId: module.id,
templateUrl: 'home.component.html'
})

export class HomeComponent {
constructor(private messageService: MessageService) {}
	
sendMessage(): void {
	// send message to subscribers via observable subject
	this.messageService.sendMessage('Message from Home Component to App Component!');
}

clearMessage(): void {
	// clear message
	this.messageService.clearMessage();
}
}

NOTE-  we used a custom asObservable() method to convert the subject into a plain observable. This custom method will not be needed in future versions of RxJs, subject.asObservable();

`https://www.techifide.com/custom-events-in-angular-2/`

# detail ABOUT Observable AND ALSO TYPES OF ALL OPERATORS BASED ON REQUIREMENTS
`http://reactivex.io/rxjs/manual/overview.html#subject`

The essential concepts in RxJS which solve async event management are:

##  Subject:-
It is an object with the methods next(v), error(e), and complete(). To feed a new value to the Subject, just call next(theValue),and it will be multicasted to the Observers registered to listen to the Subject.

private searchUpdated: Subject<string> = new Subject<string>();

onSearchType(value) {
/**
* It is an object with the methods next(v), error(e), and complete(). 
* To feed a new value to the Subject, just call next(theValue)

*/
this.searchUpdated.next(value.target.value);
/**this.searchChangeEmitter = <any>this.searchUpdated.asObservable()*/
this.searchUpdated
.debounceTime(500)
.distinctUntilChanged()
/**
* The main difference between `switchMap` and other `flattening` operators is the cancelling effect. 
On each emission the previous inner observable (the result of the function you supplied) is 
cancelled and the new observable is subscribed. You can remember this by the phrase switch to a new observable
So Switchmap is use to send latest value.
*/
.switchMap(term=> this.studentserviceService.searchProductDetail(term)) //
.subscribe(results => {
		this.results = results;
	});
}
## Observable:- 

represents the idea of an invokable collection of future values or events. and it return three type of value Observable: next, error, and complete.And obserable has three method: `next, error, and complete`.
The actual user of the observable needs to subscribe(), because without subscribe() the observable won't be executed at all.
`subscribe()` returns a Subscription that can not be subscribed to, but it can be used to cancel the subscription.
`map()` returns an Observable which can be subscribed to.

# Observer: 
is a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable. An Observer is a consumer of values delivered by an Observable. 
Observers are simply a set of callbacks, one for each type of notification delivered by the Observable: next, error, and complete. 
The following is an example of a typical Observer object:

var observer = {
next: x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),
error: err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),
complete: () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification'),
};

To use the Observer, provide it to the subscribe of an Observable:

observable.subscribe(observer);

Observers are just objects with three callbacks, one for each type of notification that an Observable may deliver.

Observers in RxJS may also be partial. If you don't provide one of the callbacks, the execution of the Observable will still happen normally, 
except some types of notifications will be ignored, because they don't have a corresponding callback in the Observer.

The example below is an Observer without the complete callback:

var observer = {
next: x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),
error: err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),
};

Internally in observable.subscribe, it will create an Observer object using the first callback argument as the next handler. All three types of callbacks may be provided as arguments:

observable.subscribe(
x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),  // first method call on success
err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),  // second method call when error
() => console.log('Observer got a complete notification')  // third method call in last
);

# Subscribing to Observables

The Observable observable in the example can be subscribed to, like this:

observable.subscribe(x => console.log(x));

Subscribing to an Observable is like calling a function, providing callbacks where the data will be delivered to.

So subscribe is basically us to call the method of observable.

# subscribe is basically us to call the method : (next, error, and complete) of observable

# Executing Observables

The execution produces multiple values over time, either synchronously or asynchronously.

There are three types of values an Observable Execution can deliver:

# "Next" notification: 
sends a value such as a Number, a String, an Object, etc.Next notifications are the most important and most common type: 
they represent actual data being delivered to an Observer. 

# "Error" notification: 
sends a JavaScript Error or exception.

#"Complete" notification: 
does not send a value.

Error and Complete notifications may happen only once during the Observable Execution, and there can only be either one of them.

# Disposing Observable Executions:

Because Observable Executions may be infinite, and it's common for an Observer to want to abort execution in finite time, 
we need an API for canceling an execution. 
Since each execution is exclusive to one Observer only, once the Observer is done receiving values, it has to have a way to stop the execution, 
in order to avoid wasting computation power or memory resources.

When observable.subscribe is called, the Observer gets attached to the newly created Observable execution. This call also returns an object,
the Subscription:

var subscription = observable.subscribe(x => console.log(x)

var subscription = observable.subscribe(x => console.log(x));

// Later:
subscription.unsubscribe();

# Subscription: 
represents the execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for canceling the execution.
A Subscription is an object that represents a disposable resource,
usually the execution of an Observable. A Subscription has one important method, unsubscribe, 
that takes no argument and just disposes the resource held by the subscription.
in previous versions of RxJS, Subscription was called "Disposable".

var observable = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);

var subscription = observable.subscribe(x => console.log(x));

// Later:
// This cancels the ongoing Observable execution which
// was started by calling subscribe with an Observer.

subscription.unsubscribe();

A Subscription essentially just has an `unsubscribe`() function to release resources or cancel Observable executions.

Subscriptions can also be put together, so that a call to an unsubscribe() of one Subscription may unsubscribe multiple Subscriptions. 
You can do this by "adding" one subscription into another:

var observable1 = Rx.Observable.interval(400);
var observable2 = Rx.Observable.interval(300);

var subscription = observable1.subscribe(x => console.log('first: ' + x));
var childSubscription = observable2.subscribe(x => console.log('second: ' + x));

subscription.add(childSubscription);

setTimeout(() => {
// Unsubscribes BOTH subscription and childSubscription
subscription.unsubscribe();
}, 1000);

# Operators: 
are pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like.
map, filter, concat, flatMap,catch etc.

RxJS is mostly useful for its operators, even though the Observable is the foundation. 
Operators are the essential pieces that allow complex asynchronous code to be easily composed in a declarative manner.

Operators are methods on the Observable type, such as .map(...), .filter(...), .merge(...), etc. 
When called, they do not change the existing Observable instance. Instead, they return a new Observable, 

# .map(...) -->> map() returns an Observable which can be subscribed to. SO .map operator is use to transform the response.
//map as a middle-ware which transforms the response into json.. if we remove it the response comes into string format.

// .map is use for transforming the original data, Suppose I have json data and we want to add some name in given name data then we can do it by .map./

// before display data into page need to transform then this is possible by .map(....) method

`Question--` Now using `subscribe(success, error, complete)` I can get all the values on the success callback and 
I can return the values on the complete callback. If I can do all theses functionalities then what is the need of map()? 
Does it give any advantage?

`Think map as a middle-ware which transforms the response.`

http.get('friends.json')
			.map(response => response.json())
			.subscribe(result => this.result =result);
			
or

http.get('friends.json')

# .switchMap(....) switchMap(switch to using data on the newer stream) is usually used when you have some async operation that is

triggered by some prepended "event/stream"
The easiest way to remember the difference between mergeMap and switchMap is
When you hear the word merge, think – use everything on all the streams aka. merge everything. Whereas when you hear the word switch,
think – switch to using data on the newer stream
This operation will discard any previous lower-order Observable when a new lower-order Observable is emitted.

# distinctUntilChanged (.....)-> 
Only emit when the current value is different than the last value.

# .debounceTime(....) -> .debounceTime(400) ->
debounceTime delays 4 sec for values emitted by the source Observable, and drops previous pending delayed emissions if a new value arrives on the source Observable.
`Don’t hit the search endpoint on every key stroke for the we have to use .debounceTime(400)`

flatMap with a function that takes a string and returns an Observable<Array<string>>.

# Difference between flatMap and map?

# Difference between switchMap and map?

# Difference between switchMap and flatMap?

The difference to e.g. `flatMap` or `concatMap` is, that as soon as the next trigger emits, the current async operation is canceled and retriggered.

In your case this means, that as soon as the type data change, your service is automatically called again with the changed 
data and the previous call is canceled so you won't receive outdated data.

So we can say that `switchMap()` always return latest value string data.
but in case of `flatMap` return old value.

The main difference between `switchMap` and other flattening operators is the `cancelling effect`. 
On each emission the previous inner observable (the result of the function you supplied) is 
cancelled and the new observable is subscribed. You can remember this by the phrase switch to a new observable.

`switchMap` will subscribe to the last Observable it encounters and unsubscribe from all previous Observables. 
This is perfect for cases like search-suggestions: once a user has changed their search query, the old request is no longer of any interest, 
so it is unsubscribed, and a well behaved Api end-point will cancel the network request.

searchStudentDetail(terms):Observable<string> {
return terms.debounceTime(400)
	.distinctUntilChanged()
	.switchMap(term => this.httpMethodService.getSearchEntries( // switchMap is also use for search operation process
		HTTP_URL.baseCuntryUrl, 
		HTTP_URL.queryCountryUrl, 
		term
	));
}	

whose subscription logic is based on the first Observable.

An Operator is essentially a pure function which takes one Observable as input and generates another Observable as output. 
Subscribing to the output Observable will also subscribe to the input Observables

# debounceTime:

debounceTime delays values emitted by the source Observable, but drops previous pending delayed emissions
if a new value arrives on the source Observable. This operator keeps track of the most recent value from the source Observable,
and emits that only when dueTime enough time has passed without any other value appearing on the source Observable. 
If a new value appears before dueTime silence occurs, the previous value will be dropped and will not be emitted on the output Observable.

# debounce:
debounce delays values emitted by the source Observable, but drops previous pending delayed emissions.
if a new value arrives on the source Observable. This operator keeps track of the most recent value from the source Observable, 
and spawns a duration Observable by calling the durationSelector function. The value is emitted only 
when the duration Observable emits a value or completes, and if no other value was emitted on the source Observable 
since the duration Observable was spawned. If a new value appears before the duration Observable emits, 
the previous value will be dropped and will not be emitted on the output Observable.

# Subject: 
is the equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of multi casting a value or event to multiple Observers.
There are also a few specializations of the Subject type: BehaviorSubject, ReplaySubject, and AsyncSubject.

# Schedulers: 
are centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens on e.g. 
setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame or others.

`https://www.codementor.io/christiannwamba/build-custom-directives-in-angular-2-jlqrk7dpw`

## all about EventEmitter in angular2 

`https://angular.io/api/core/EventEmitter`
	
`eventEmmiter` call every times when any changes occur but `observable` call only one time call second time is code of that observable run again also use `EventEmitter <object>`, `EventEmitter <number>`, `EventEmitter <string>`

# difference between EventEmitter and observable --

There are three methods I have seen to manage change detection in Angular2.

`1- Observables`

`2- EventEmitter.-:` 

eventEmitter is also use inside the service to get changes if any use add in group and the emit the event and then return the custom event.and also use inside the share data in child to parent.

EventEmitteris also use inside the service in that case when we want that if any new user fill the form then in that case to check who is new user so by using EventEmitter we ca do it. Also in that case when any any user delete from table form data then in that case we use EventEmitter to check who is the user delete from data base ND THIS IS DONE BY USING EventEmitter.anD In both case we sue EventEmitter inside the service.

`3- Dot Rule`

My question is, all three implementations can work when subscribing to watch changes in data. How do you decide when to use one instead of the other, and what are the drawbacks of each.

`https://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-custom-event-binding-eventemitter-example`

Angular framework provides event binding using in-built event as well as custom event. 
Event binding is achieved using parenthesis () and on- keyword. When using parenthesis (), we need to write our event name inside it. 
When using on- keyword, on- is added as prefix with event name. 

Custom events are the `EventEmitter` instances. To create a custom event we need to create an `instance of EventEmitter` annotated by `@Output()`.

`@Output() searchChangeEmitter: EventEmitter<any> = new EventEmitter<any>();`

`// searchChangeEmitter is a custom event which are create using instance of EventEmitter.`

`// EventEmitter is an angular2 abstraction and its only purpose is to emit events in components.`
		
# Child to Parent: Sharing Data via Output() and EventEmitter

So we can use EventEmitter in that case when we need to share the data from child to parent and in that case 
we define EventEmitter with @output inside the child component and also call emit method and pass parameter inside the emit method and that parameters the data inside the child component and that data need to share inside the parent.

#inside the child component-:

`@Output() notify: EventEmitter<string> = new EventEmitter<string>(); // notify is a custom event which are create using instance of EventEmitter.`

message1: string = "Holt Munro!"
	onClick() {
	this.notify.emit(this.message1); // Then this instance calls emit() method to emit payload which can be received by event object $event. 
	}
	

# inside the parent component.ts --

onNotify(message:string):void {  //onNotify() it is method inside the parent.ts component
this.parentTitle=message;
}  		  

# inside the parent component.html  

<app-child [title]='childTitle' (notify)='onNotify($event)'></app-child> //(notify) is custom method which are use to share the data to parent component
<div>
Name: {{parentTitle}}
</div>

`NOTE- Use by directives and components to emit custom Events.`	


# Use of EventEmitter inside the directive?

# Use of EventEmitter inside the service ?

# Use of EventEmitter inside the component ?


# EventEmitter can also use to share data without parent child relation use it inside the service and patch data:

inside the directive using subscribe and to use value from eventEmmiter we need to use subscribe also.

# How to subscribe to an event on a service in Angular2?:

# nav.service.ts

import {EventEmitter} from 'angular2/core';
export class NavService {
navchange: EventEmitter<number> = new EventEmitter();
constructor() {}
emitNavChangeEvent(number) {
this.navchange.emit(number);
}
getNavChangeEmitter() {
return this.navchange;
}
} 

# components.ts

import {Component} from 'angular2/core';
import {NavService} from '../services/NavService';

@Component({
selector: 'obs-comp',
template: `obs component, item: {{item}}`
})
export class ObservingComponent {
item: number = 0;
subscription: any;

ngOnInit() {
this.subscription = this.navService.getNavChangeEmitter()
	.subscribe(item => this.selectedNavItem(item));
}

item = 1;
constructor(private navService:NavService) {}
selectedNavItem(item: number) {
console.log('selected nav item ' + item);
this.navService.emitNavChangeEvent(item);
}
}

##  What is difference between `subject` and `EventEmitter`?

There is not much difference. `EventEmitter extends Subject`.

`@Output() navchange: EventEmitter<number> = new EventEmitter(); // Use EventEmitter inside the service to get the latest value which are receive from component` 

emitNavChangeEvent(number) {
this.navchange.emit(number);// it will contain latest value which are receive from component
}	  
getNavChangeEmitter() {
return this.navchange.asObservable(); //TO get value inside the component
} 


export class MessageService {
private subject = new Subject<any>(); // Use subject inside the service to get the latest value which are receive from component

sendMessage(message: string) {
	this.subject.next({ text: message }); // it will contain latest value which are receive from component
}

clearMessage() {
	this.subject.next();
}

getMessage(): Observable<any> {
	return this.subject.asObservable();  // TO USE SUBJECT DATA USING SubscribE FIRST WE NEED TO CONVERT IT INTO OBSERABLE.
}
}

`https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34376854/delegation-eventemitter-or-observable-in-angular/35568924#35568924`

`We can use subject, BehaviorSubject and EventEmitter inside the service to get data from component and then use that data inside the component receive data from service into component.`

## Example of BehaviorSubject inside the service
The BehaviorSubject holds the value that needs to be shared with other components. These components subscribe to data which is simple returning the BehaviorSubject value without the functionality to change the value. And to get value from BehaviorSubject we have to subscribe.

The BehaviorSubject has the characteristic that it stores the “current” value. This means that you can always directly get the last emitted value from the BehaviorSubject.


There are two ways to get this last emited value. You can either get the value by accessing the .value property on the BehaviorSubject or you can subscribe to it. If you subscribe to it, the BehaviorSubject will directly emit the current value to the subscriber. Even if the subscriber subscribes much later than the value was stored. 



`In service.ts :`

export class NavService {
// Observable navItem source
private _navItemSource = new BehaviorSubject<number>(0);
// Observable navItem stream
navItem$ = this._navItemSource.asObservable();
// service command
changeNav(number) {
this._navItemSource.next(number);
}
}

`In component1.ts :`

export class ObservingComponent {
item: number;
subscription:Subscription;
constructor(private _navService:NavService) {}
ngOnInit() {
this.subscription = this._navService.navItem$
.subscribe(item => this.item = item)
}
ngOnDestroy() {
// prevent memory leak when component is destroyed
this.subscription.unsubscribe();
}
}

`In component2.ts :`

@Component({
selector: 'my-nav',
template:`
<div class="nav-item" (click)="selectedNavItem(1)">nav 1 (click me)</div>
<div class="nav-item" (click)="selectedNavItem(2)">nav 2 (click me)</div>`
})
export class Navigation {
item = 1;
constructor(private _navService:NavService) {}
selectedNavItem(item: number) {
this._navService.changeNav(item);

### CUSTOM DIRECTIVE INSIDE THE ANGULAR2

# Types of Directives

`Angular 2 categorizes directives into 3 parts:`

1- Directives with templates known as `Components`

2- Directives that creates and destroys DOM elements known as `Structural Directives`

3- Directives that manipulate DOM by changing behavior and appearance known as `Attribute Directives`

The most important difference with the way we created our `attribute directive` is how they are provided to the DOM. 

`Attribute directive` uses `ElementRef` and `Renderer` to render and re-render.
while `structural directives` use `TemplateRef` and `ViewContainerRef` to update the DOM content.

The most important difference with the way we created our `attribute directive` is how they are provided to the DOM. 
`Attribute directive` uses `ElementRef` and `Renderer` to render and re-render while `structural directives` use `TemplateRef` and `ViewContainerRef` to update the DOM content.

The Angular Directive can be classified into two types: `structural and attribute directives`.

`1- Custom Attribute Directives -:`
`Attribute Directive` is basically used to modify or alter the appearance and behavior of an element. An `Attribute directive` changes the appearance or behavior of a DOM element.

`Attribute directive uses `ElementRef` and `Renderer` to render and re-render.`

`https://www.codementor.io/christiannwamba/build-custom-directives-in-angular-2-jlqrk7dpw`



`Attribute directives`, as the name goes, are applied as `attributes to elements`. 
They are used to manipulate the DOM in all kinds of different ways except creating or destroying them.  `(/search-student.componts and in directive-event-emitter.directive and ViewcolordirectiveDirective)`

# Directives in this categories can help us achieve one of the following tasks:

`1- Apply conditional styles and classes to elements`

<p [style.color]="'blue'">Directives are awesome</p>

`2- Hide and show elements, conditionally (different from creating and destroying elements)`

<p [hidden]="shouldHide">Directives are awesome</p>		

Angular custom attribute is created to change appearance and behavior of HTML element.
1. Use ElementRef class to access DOM to change host element appearance. on which element directive is use.		
2. Use @Input() decorator to accept user input in our custom directive. 
3. Use @HostListener() decorator to listen events in custom attribute directive.

`Create Attribute Directive using @Input()-:`  Angular custom directive can also accept input from the user. 
To accept input within directive we need to declare a property decorated with @Input(). 

`Create Attribute Directive using @HostListener()-:`

If we want to change element appearance in DOM on any event then we need to listen event in our custom directive. 
To listen event we will use Angular @HostListener() decorator in our custom directive. 
The event name will be assigned to @HostListener() decorator. 

`2-  Structural Directives -:` Structural directives are responsible for shape or reshape the DOM’s structure, typically by adding, removing, 
or manipulating elements. Similar to other directives, you apply a structural directive to a host element(element on which directive apply).
The directive then does whatever it’s designed to do with that host element. 

`Structural directives are easy to recognize. An asterisk (*) precedes the directive attribute name. `
`It does not require brackets or parentheses like attribute directive.`

Three of the common, built-in structural directives are NgIf, NgFor, and NgSwitch. Let us take a look how they look in a template:

<div *ngIf="movie" >{{movie.name}}</div>

<ul>    

<li *ngFor="let movie of movies">{{movie.name}}</li>

</ul>

<div [ngSwitch]="movie?.genre">  
<action-movie *ngSwitchCase="'action'" [movie]=" movie "></action-movie>  
<horror-movie *ngSwitchCase="'horror'" [movie]=" movie "></horror-movie>  
<thriller-movie *ngSwitchCase="'thriller'" [movie]=" movie "></thriller-movie>  
<unknown-movie *ngSwitchDefault [movie]=" movie "></unknown-movie>
</div>

## Why we use Asterisk (*)?

<div *ngIf="movie">{{movie.name}}</div>
Internally, Angular decouples it in two stages. First, it translates the *ngIf=”…” into a template attribute, template = “ngIf …” and then it becomes:

<div template="ngIf movie">{{movie.name}}</div>

Then it translates the template attribute into a <ng-template> element, wrapped around the host element as shown below.

<ng-template [ngIf]="movie">

<div>
{{movie.name}} 
</div>

</ng-template>

## *ngFor : IT IS ALSO Structural DIRECTIVE

<div *ngFor="let movie of movies">{{movie.name}}</div>
<div template="ngFor let movie of movies">{{movie.name}}</div>
<ng-template ngFor let-movie [ngForOf]="movies">{{movie.name}}
</ng-template>


`https://www.edureka.co/blog/angular-directive/` (BEST)

You can only apply one `structural directive` per host element. For an example, 
if you want to repeat a block of HTML but only when a particular condition is true. 
You’ll try to put both an `*ngFor` and an `*ngIf` on the same host element. Angular won’t let you. 
You may apply only one `structural directive` to an element.

The reason is simplicity. `Structural directives` can do complex things with the host element. 
When two directives lay claim to the same host element, which one takes precedence? Which should go first, the `NgIf` or the `NgFor`?

`NOTE- You can only apply one structural directive per host element.`


`NgSwitch Directive -:` It is also structural directive.

The element to which you apply a directive is its host element. The <action-movie> is the host element for the happy *ngSwitchCase. 
The <unknown-movie> is the host element for the *ngSwitchDefault.

<div [ngSwitch]="movie?.genre">  
<action-movie *ngSwitchCase="'action'" [movie]=" movie "></action-movie>  
<horror-movie *ngSwitchCase="'horror'" [movie]=" movie "></horror-movie>  
<thriller-movie *ngSwitchCase="'thriller'" [movie]=" movie "></thriller-movie>  
<unknown-movive *ngSwitchDefault [movie]=" movie "></unknown-movie>
</div>

Internally, it is also converted into the <ng-template> element form. Then it looks like:	

<div [ngSwitch]="movie?.genre">  
<ng-template [ngSwitchCase]="'action'">    
<action-movie [movie]="movie"></ action-movie >  
</ng-template>  
<ng-template [ngSwitchCase]="'sad'">    
<horror-movie [movie]="movie"></horror-movie>  
</ng-template>  
<ng-template [ngSwitchCase]="'confused'">    
<thriller-movie [movie]="movie"></thriller-movie>  
</ng-template >  
<ng-template ngSwitchDefault>    
<unknown-movie [movie]="movie"></unknown-movie>
</ng-template>
</div>

`Directives that creates and destroys DOM elements known as Structural Directives.`

`https://www.codementor.io/christiannwamba/build-custom-directives-in-angular-2-jlqrk7dpw`

`https://www.edureka.co/blog/angular-directive/`  (Best)

`Structural directives` alter layout by adding, removing, and replacing elements in DOM.

`Structural directives` are not DOM-friendly in the sense that they create, destroy, or re-create DOM elements based on certain conditions.

This is a huge difference from what hidden `attribute directive` does. This is because hidden retains the DOM element but hides it from the user,whereas structural directives like `*ngIf` destroy the elements.`*ngFor` and [ngSwitch] are also common `structural directives`.

<li *ngFor="let movie of movies"></li>

*ngFor is a looping variable that tells Angular to take one <li> per movie from the movies list.

<movie-detail *ngIf="selectedMovie"></movie-detail>

*ngIf will include the MovieDetail component only if a movie is selected otherwise it will remove it from the DOM.	

`Structural directives`, as we have already discussed, manipulate the DOM. Such manipulations can create (not show) and destroy (not hide) DOM elements.`structural directives` use `TemplateRef` and `ViewContainerRef` to update the DOM content.

`NOTE- We can use two custom structural directive together. but with two different-2 host element name.`

`NOTE- * indicate that it is Structural Directive.`

`NOTE- decorator-:` Decorators are functions that modify JavaScript classes. Decorators are used for attaching metadata to classes, 
it knows the configuration of those classes and how they should work. It means decorator is a method which contain the metaData about the class that how can we use that class.

## Difference between ElementRef and Renderer ?

`https://www.code-sample.com/2017/06/angular-2-elementref-vs-renderer.html`

`https://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-4-renderer2-example`

`ElementRef vs. Renderer -:`

In Angular `Renderer` and `ElementRef` are used for DOM Manipulation and `Renderer` and `ElementRef` are used together to get full platform abstraction. 

## ElementRef security risk angular 2:
https://medium.com/@kmathy/angular-manipulate-properly-the-dom-with-renderer-16a756508cba
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42834226/elementref-security-risk-angular-2

If you are only using an ElementRef to get information, like in your example a certain width, there is no security risk involved at all. It's a different story when you use an ElementRef to modify the DOM. There, potential threats can arise. Such an example could be:

 The problem with this is that it gets inserted directly into the DOM, skipping the Angular sanitisation mechanisms. What are sanitisation mechanisms? Usually,if something in the DOM is changed via Angular, Angular makes sure it's nothing dangerous. However, when using ElementRef to insert something into the DOM, Angular can't guarantee this. So it becomes your responsibility that nothing bad enters the DOM when using ElementRef. An important keyword here is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).


` If you poll the DOM for information, you are safe. If you modify the DOM using ElementRef, make sure the modifications don't possibly contain malicious code.`

## Difference between `TemplateRef` and `ViewContainerRef` ?

## What is nativeElement ? :

## Difference between TemplateRef and ViewContainerRef ?-:

A simple structural angular directive creates an embedded view from the Angular-generated <ng-template> and inserts that view in a 
view container adjacent to the directive’s original <p> host element. You’ll acquire the <ng-template> contents with a TemplateRef and 
access the view container through a ViewContainerRef. You inject both in the directive constructor as private variables of the class.

TemplateRef-: You’ll acquire the <ng-template> contents with a TemplateRef. host element will come inside the <ng-template>.

ViewContainerRef-: access the view container through a ViewContainerRef. It is use for container.

`https://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-custom-structural-directive-example`  (best example)

`ViewContainerRef-:`  It represents a container where one or more views can be attached.

It represents a container where one or more views can be attached. We can use its methods such as createEmbeddedView() and createComponent().

ViewContainerRef Represents a container where one or more Views can be attached.The container can contain two kinds of Views. Host Views, created by instantiating a Component via createComponent(), and Embedded Views, created by instantiating an Embedded Template via createEmbeddedView().

If you ever needed to insert new component or template programmatically, you probably used the ViewContainerRef service.
When you need to add new DOM element (i.e., component, template) you need a place to insert the element. and that place will provide by ViewContainerRef.

Angular is not magic; it’s just JavaScript. If you want to insert new component or template, you need to tell Angular where to put this element.
So ViewContainerRef is the place where we can put the new DOM element (i.e., component, template).

`https://netbasal.com/angular-2-understanding-viewcontainerref-acc183f3b682`  (best)

## What is Host Views and Embedded Views?

`Host Views --- Host Views means component.`
`Embedded Views -- Embedded Views means template.`

`What is the difference between createEmbeddedView and createComponent in Angular ?`

These both methods are used to dynamically add content to the component view (DOM).This content can be either a template or a component based.

* createComponent -->> createComponent is use when we need to insert component.
* createEmbeddedView -->> createEmbeddedView is use when we need to insert template.

When should we use TemplateRef and when should we use ViewContainerRef ?

# clear the concept of  @Input() set in custom directive

@Input() set is use in child component when we need to change the value of child component variable based on parent component variable.

Child.ts-:

import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
selector: 'app-name-child',
template: '<h3>"{{name}}"</h3>'
})
export class NameChildComponent {
private _name = '';

@Input()
set name(name: string) {
this._name = (name && name.trim()) || '<no name set>';
}

get name(): string { return this._name; }
}

parent.ts-:

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
selector: 'app-name-parent',
template: `
<h2>Master controls {{names.length}} names</h2>
<app-name-child *ngFor="let name of names" [name]="name"></app-name-child>
`
})

export class NameParentComponent {
// Displays 'Mr. IQ', '<no name set>', 'Bombasto'

### Difference in attribute and property of element? -:


## @ViewChild and @ViewChildren : 

`@ViewChild()-:`
`https://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-viewchild-example`

`@ViewChild()` provides the instance of another component or directive in a parent component and then parent component can 
access the methods and properties of that component or directive.

1. Suppose we have a component named as StopwatchComponent then within a parent component, we use it as follows.
@ViewChild(StopwatchComponent)
private stopwatchComponent: StopwatchComponent;	


2. Now suppose we have a directive CpColorDirective, then we use it as follows.
@ViewChild(CpColorDirective)
private cpColorDirective: CpColorDirective; 


## `@ViewChild() using Component-:`

@ViewChild() can be used for component communication.` A component will get instance of another component inside it using @ViewChild(). `

It means if we will use @ViewChild() inside the component then we can create instance of that componet and after that we can use method of that instance component use inside parent component.

In this way parent component will be able to `access the properties and methods of child component.` 
The child component selector will be used in parent component HTML template.
 So that we can call `child component` method from `parent componet`.

`child.component.ts-:`

@Component({
selector: 'app-stopwatch',
template: '<h2>{{counter}}</h2>'
})
export class StopwatchComponent {
shouldRun:boolean = false;
counter:number = 0;
start() {
	this.shouldRun = true;
	let interval = setInterval(() =>
	{  
	if(this.shouldRun === false){
		clearInterval(interval);
	}
	this.counter = this.counter + 1;			
	}, 1000);
}
stop() {
	this.shouldRun = false;
}
} 

`parent.component.ts-:`
@Component({
selector: 'app-stopwatch-parent',
templateUrl: './parent.component.html'
})
export class StopwatchParentComponent {
`@ViewChild(StopwatchComponent) /// child component`
private stopwatchComponent: StopwatchComponent; // instance of child component
startStopwatch() {
	this.stopwatchComponent.start(); // this method of child component
}
stopStopwatch() {
	this.stopwatchComponent.stop(); // this method of child component
}
}

`parent.component.html-:`

<h3>@ViewChild using Component</h3>
Stopwatch Example: 
<button type="button" (click)="startStopwatch()">Start</button>
<button type="button" (click)="stopStopwatch()">Stop</button>

<br/>
<app-stopwatch></app-stopwatch>


## `@ViewChild() using Directive-:`

@ViewChild() can instantiate a directive within a component and in this way the` component will be able to access the directive methods. `

it menas if we will `create instance of directive inside the component then we can use method of directive inside the component.`

Here we will create a directive that will contain the methods to change the text color of the host element of DOM layout


`cpcolor.directive.ts-:`

import { Directive, ElementRef, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({ 
selector: '[cpColor]' 
})
export class CpColorDirective implements AfterViewInit{
constructor(private elRef: ElementRef) {
}
ngAfterViewInit() {
this.elRef.nativeElement.style.color = 'red';
}
change(changedColor: String) {
this.elRef.nativeElement.style.color = changedColor;
}
} 

`Now create the component, that will instantiate CpColorDirective and access its methods.`

`cpcolor-parent.component.ts -:`

import { Component, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { CpColorDirective } from './cpcolor.directive';

@Component({
selector: 'app-cpcolor-parent',
templateUrl: './cpcolor-parent.component.html'
})
export class CpColorParentComponent {
`@ViewChild(CpColorDirective)`
`private cpColorDirective: CpColorDirective;`
changeColor(color: string) {
this.cpColorDirective.change(color);
}
}

`cpcolor-parent.component.html -:`

<h3>@ViewChild using Directive</h3>
Color Example:
<p cpColor>Change my Color </p>
<div>
Change Color:
<input type="radio" name="rad" (click)= "changeColor('green')"> Green
<input type="radio" name="rad" (click)= "changeColor('cyan')"> Cyan
<input type="radio" name="rad" (click)= "changeColor('blue')"> Blue
</div> 


`@ViewChild() with Template Variable using ElementRef to access Native Element -:`

`https://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-viewchild-example`


`@ViewChild() can instantiate ElementRef corresponding to a given template reference variable. The template variable name will be passed in @ViewChild() as an argument. In this way component will be able to change the appearance and behavior of element of given template variable.`

It means if we want to change appearance and behavior of element of given template variable for same component then we can use @ViewChild().

<input type="text" name="datebaseRange" value="01/01/2018 - 01/15/2018"  #dateRangePicker/>
  @ViewChild('dateRangePicker') dateRangePicker;

** if we will console viewChild inside the constractor then it will return undefined.

** Alway use viewChild inside the ngAfterViewInit().

** 

`@ViewChildren -:`
@ViewChildren return list of element. so we have to use QueryList to get list of elements.
and we have to convert into arrary form.

`NOTE- Note that view children will not be set until the ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hook is called.`

`The @ViewChild and @ViewChildren decorators provide access to the class of child component from the containing component.`
`So that we can use property and method of child component inside the parent component.`

You can use ViewChildren to get the QueryList of elements or directives from the view DOM. Any time a child element is added, removed, 
or moved, the query list will be updated, and the changes observable of the query list will emit a new value.

NOTE- if we use multiple time same child component or multiple times same directive name on Parent component page and all child component, or all directive
add or remove based on condition then in that case we have to use @ViewChildren to get method and property of the directive or child component.


When there are multiple embedded components in the template, we can also use @ViewChildren. It collects a list of instances of the Alert component, 
stored in a QueryList object that behaves similar to an array.

@ViewChildren(PanedirectiveDirective) panes: QueryList<PanedirectiveDirective>;
alertsArr = [];

ngAfterViewInit() {
this.alertsArr = this.panes.toArray();
console.log(this.panes);  
}	

* @ContentChild and @ContentChildren

`https://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-4-contentchild-and-contentchildren-example`

`@ContentChild and @ContentChildren -:` @ContentChild and @ContentChildren work the same way as the equivalent @ViewChild and @ViewChildren, 

however, the key difference is that @ContentChild and @ContentChildren select from 

This page will walk through Angular @ContentChild and @ContentChildren decorator example. They are used to fetch first or all elements from content DOM. 
@ContentChild gives first element matching the selector from the content DOM. @ContentChildren gives all elements of content DOM as QueryList.

@ContentChild and @ContentChildren both are decorators. They are used to fetch single child element or all child elements from content DOM



###  When I have to use Observable.of

event.debounceTime(400)
	.distinctUntilChanged()
	.switchMap(term => this.studentserviceService.searchProductDetail(event))
	.subscribe(results => {
	this.results = results;
});


## AOT:-

With AOT, you can build the application offline (in a kind of step-by-step build), and once the compilation is done, we can upload the compiled version. This may lead to performance improvements (such as faster loading times) and also reduce the size of the program.

`Oh, another cool feature of the AOT is `Tree Shaking,`` which does nothing but reads the dependency graph from top to bottom and “shakes” the unused code. It greatly reduces the downloaded size of the application, so for example, if you are not using code from @angular/forms then it will not download Forms-related code. Also, AOT and Tree Shaking are different processes, but AOT helps the code, making it more shakable by converting the HTML code to JavaScript so the Tree shaker can process more of our application.

Observables are elements that will give us information. In order to get access to those information, we need to subscribe to them 


###  What do you mean by Consider AOT compilation. The Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler

###  Just-in-Time (JiT) vs Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation

JIT -- use for load dynamic dependency

And meaning of JIT is just before the app is run in your browser.


###  The Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler

not load dynamic dependency

`https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler`

The Angular Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler converts your Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build
phase before the browser downloads and runs that code.

Before the browser can render the application, the components and templates must be converted to executable JavaScript by an Angular compiler.

Angular offers two ways to compile your application:
1- Just-in-Time (JIT), which compiles your app in the browser at runtime
2- Ahead-of-Time (AOT), which compiles your app at build time.
Q-1: Difference in Compile,Build,Run time--->>>
Q-2: When page load first time then all data define intn route load at time of loading or load when 
we we navigate on route if yes then what is use of lazyloading
Q-3: how can we diff Angular 1 and Angular2 in case fo performance
Q-4: what is main use of JIT and AOT: It is use to compaile the code means convert into TS--JS--binary code for brqwser
Q-5: use of webpack :-- It is use for build the code means minifide code
Q-6: Remove scripts,stylesheet from index.html : 
Q-7: Use Browser Caching : What browser caching does is "remember" the resources that the browser has already loaded. When a visitor goes to another page on your website your logo, CSS files, etc. do not need to be loaded again, because the browser has them "remembered" (saved). This is the reason that the first view of a web page takes longer than repeat visits.
Q-8: Use Browser Caching : it is good pratice
Q-9: minimize the code in app.component.ts : its meaning
Q-10: set data on app Initialization : its meaning
Q-11: 

### ANGULAR2 LIFECYCLE HOOKS

There are eight main hooks for every component to have robustness in our built applications.

`1- Constructor:`  This won’t be taken as lifecycle hooks but this will instantiate all component hooks and it is run first when the component is activated.

>app.ts file:
class MyComponent {
constructor( ) {
/*all other modules injection and dependency injection and initialization will go here*/
console.log(“This is Constructor”); // printed first in console
}
}


`2- ngOnChanges:` run before ngOnInit when page is load at first time. after that call infinite time when any changes occure in component.

This hook will be run when our component is setting or resetting the values for input properties.This will be called before ngOnInit 
hook whenever the changes in the input property made in a component.
This will be used to render the DOM and updating the DOM for each and every changes made in the component attributes.
This may run multiple times in the lifetime of the each component
>app.ts file:
class MyComponent {
ngOnChanges( ) {
/*Called when the changes made in the input properties of the component before it binds to view*/
console.log(“This is ngOnChange”); 
}
}

`3- ngOnInit:` iN IT WE SET INTIAL VALUE WHICH ARE USE AT THE TIME When PAGE IS LOAD  FIRST TIME.
The Initialization of the component or directive of our app will be made in this hook after the angular displays the initial value of input properties.
When changes made in input properties of the component this hook will be called after the ngOnChanges.
This hook will run only one time after initializing all the properties of the component
>app.ts file:
class MyComponent {
ngOnInit( ) {
/*the Initialization of every input properties and functionalities will go here*/
console.log(“This is ngOnInit”); 
}
}

`4- ngDoCheck:`
This will be called immediately after ngOnInit, And called on every change made in component properties, So the operations that have to be done on the change of any input properties can be written in this hook.
This will be executed for every change detection in cycles even there is no properties changed
>app.ts file:
class MyComponent {
ngDoCheck( ) {
/*The functionalities to be done for every change made in input properties will go here*/

console.log(“This is ngDoCheck”);
}
}

`5- ngAfterContentInit:`

`6- ngAfterContentChecked:`

`7- ngAfterViewInit:` Called when the angular checks the view of the component and child views of the components.
It will check all the HTML view has been initialized
>app.ts file:
class MyComponent {
ngAfterViewInit( ) {
/*The functionalities to be done when initialization of the whole content has been projected into view will go here*/
console.log(“This is ngAfterViewInit”); /*printed when the whole content is projected in view and runs only once*/
}
}

`8- ngAfterViewChecked:`

###  Start Node JS.

Event Loop->>	
Note- Due to the non-blocking nature of setTimeout,

`http://altitudelabs.com/blog/what-is-the-javascript-event-loop/`

## call stack --??

## Event Table ---- ???

there’s a process that constantly checks whether the call stack is empty, and whenever it’s empty, 
it checks if the event queue has any functions waiting to be invoked. If it does, then the first function in the queue gets invoked 
and moved over into the call stack. If the event queue is empty, then this monitoring process just keeps on running indefinitely.

## single-threaded and the asynchronous  -->> ???

`https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4531649/what-exactly-is-node-js-used-for`  (need to clear)

`https://dzone.com/articles/common-uses-for-nodejs`

`NOTE- Node.js uses an event-driven input-output (I/O) which makes it perfect for the implementation of real-time web applications.`

Since Node.js acts as an efficient and responsive web server, it allows for the creation of real-time web applications that can run smoothly. 

Traditional web servers require the creation of a new thread when a new connection is made. 
This limits the number of connections and depletes system resources. Node, on the other hand, only uses a single thread to handle all connections. 
This makes it great for web applications that require scalability and it is also extremely easy to install.

Node.js makes it easy to implement real-time web applications in JavaScript. IT MEANS??

In Node.js, he gave developers a tool for working in the non-blocking, event-driven I/O paradigm.

How it works under-the-hood is pretty interesting. Compared to traditional web-serving techniques where each connection (request) 
spawns a new thread, taking up system RAM and eventually maxing-out at the amount of RAM available, Node.js operates on a single-thread, 
using non-blocking I/O calls, allowing it to support tens of thousands of concurrent connections (held in the event loop).

NOTE- ALL CLIENT SIDE SCRIPTING LANGUAGE ONLY RUN ON CLIENT SIDE MEANS ONLY IN BROWSER.
CLIENT SIDE MEANS RUN ON ONLY BROWSER Only. WHATE EVER WE WRITE CODE IN JAVASCRIPT IN BACKEN IT RUN THE C++ CODE BECAUSE JAVASCRIPT
IS WRITTEN C++.WHICH IS HANDLE IN BROWSER.

### What is meaning of event-driven input-output (I/O) in node js.

## what is V8 google?

`Multithreading ->>` they execute independently but share their process resources.
A thread maintains a list of information relevant to its execution including the priority schedule, exception handlers, a set of CPU registers, 
and stack state in the address space of its hosting process.

/*****************************Multi-threading in JavaScript**********************/	

`https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/dotnet/asp-net/javascript-single-threaded/`

JavaScript doesn’t really have multi-threading capabilities, and there’s nothing a JavaScript programmer can do to change that. 
In all browsers – apart from Google Chrome – JavaScript runs in a single execution thread,

all our JavaScript code should be executed in single thread, while at the same time ensuring that it handles all the events and doesn’t lose any callback. 
For these reasons we come to the Event loop.	

## As described in the picture, the main parts of JavaScript Event loop are:-->>
`https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/dotnet/asp-net/javascript-single-threaded/`
1- The Call stack, which is a usual call stack that contains all called functions.
2- The Event handlers queue, a queue of event handlers that are waiting to be executed.
3- The Event loop, which is a process that checks whether events handlers queue is not empty and if it is – calls top event handler and removes it from queue.
and move that event inside the call Stack.
4- Event loop check in call stack if it empaty then check event handler queue if any method is in event handler queue then move it inside the call stack for execution.


/********************Node JS Single Threaded Event Loop Model***********************/

NOTE_ Node.js is also based on the JavaScript framework, but it is used for developing server-based applications.
`https://www.journaldev.com/7462/node-js-architecture-single-threaded-event-loop`  (bets follow read only this site)
`https://blog.risingstack.com/your-first-node-js-http-server/` (Node Hero - Your First Node.js HTTP Server tutorial )


`https://www.guru99.com/node-js-tutorial.html`  (node-js-tutorial)
`https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/index.htm` (node-js-tutorial)

NOTE- The main heart of Node JS Processing model is “Event Loop”. If we understand this, then it is very easy to understand the Node JS Internals.
It means Node js follow the FIFO concept and put all request coming from client into QUEUE( It is known as “Event Queue”.) and work on request based on QUEUE data.
Node JS Web Server internally has a Component, known as “Event Loop”.and and based on Event Loop concept it pull method from QUESUE for work
Event Loop uses Single Thread only. It is main heart of Node JS Platform Processing Model.

Even Loop checks any Client Request is placed in Event Queue. If no, then wait for incoming requests for indefinitely.

### 1- How Node JS handles concurrent request with Single-Threaded model ???

As we have already discussed, Node JS applications uses “Single Threaded Event Loop Model” architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients.

Node JS Platform --->>

Node JS Platform uses “Single Threaded Event Loop” architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients. 

Event Loop -->>  The event loop is in the heart of Node.js / Javascript - it is responsible for scheduling asynchronous operations.	

Event-driven programming --->>
Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), 
sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads.

What are modules in Node.js? -->>>

### Concept of cors origin problem: And to solve it we have to add below code in server side 

`/**
 `* Need to set header when we run using different port.`

## Difference between Angular2 and Angular5

`Angular 4 has following new features –`
* Animations Animations now have their own package i.e. @angular/platform-browser/animations
* Templates – template is now ng-template. you should use the ng-template tag
* Angular Universal: it’s possible to render Angular applications outside of the browser.
* Email Validator – In Angular 2.0, we use an email validator, using pattern option. but in Angular 4.0, there is a validator to validate an email.

`Angular 5 has following new features –`
The main purpose of Angular 5 is to make angular more faster. In this loading time as well as execution time has been improved.
# Service Worker support in the CLI: Using @angular/service-worker can improve the loading performance of your applications.
Performance is always important for every web application. It’s more important for mobile and wi-fi users. Modern browsers have a new API for building sites that load reliably and quickly, called the Service Worker API.

# Improved `Universal` & `AppShell` Support in the CLI:

## universal :
If you want to add universal into your current CLI application, you can use the below command –

`ng generate universal`

## AppShell :
Angular 5 also support AppShell. App Shell uses the router to render your application.
If you want to support AppShell in your application then use the below command –

`ng generate app-shell`

`b) Compiler Improvements:` This is one of the very nice features of Angular 5, which improved the support of incremental compilation of an application.

https://blog.angular.io/angular-5-1-more-now-available-27d372f5eb4e

`c) New Router Lifecycle Events:`
`d) Angular Universal State Transfer API and DOM Support:` By using this feature, we can now share the state of the application between the server side and client side very easily.
`e) Preserve Whitespace:` 
http://www.softwarearchitekt.at/post/2017/08/31/clever-white-space-handling-for-better-performance-in-angular-5.aspx
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46018599/how-to-globally-set-the-preservewhitespaces-option-in-angular-to-false
https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/21049
https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/22027

If you want to restrict them only for TestComponent  then below is the sample code,

@Component({  
            templateUrl: 'test.component.html',  
           ` preserveWhitespaces: false ` 
        }  
        export class TestComponent {}  


`If you want to restrict them throughout the application level then we have add the below lines of code in tsconfig.json file.`

"angularCompilerOptions": {  
    "preserveWhitespaces": false  
} 

f) `Improved in faster Compiler support :`

A huge improvement made in an Angular compiler to make the development build faster. We can now take advantage of by running the below command in our development terminal window to make the build faster.

`ng serve/s --aot`

g) `Compiler improvements:` This can help in faster re-builds of applications, mainly for compilations and production builds with `AOT`.

h) `Router Events :` The new events are the following: ActivationStart, ActivationEnd,  ChildActivationStart, ChildActivationEnd, GuardsCheckEnd, GuardsCheckStart, ResolveStart and ResolveEnd.

i) `@angular/service-worker :`

## How to Update to Angular 5 :
If you want to upgrade any version of angular to Angular 5, then go to angular official website, this gives you a tool as below

#### Angular 5 features include :

* A build optimiser which removed unnecessary code from applications 
* Angular `Universal State` Transfer API and DOM Support
* The Angular compiler has been improved to support incremental compilation
* Multiple names are supported for components and directives
* 

### UNDERSTANDING ANGULAR 5 FEATURES STEP BY STEP : [`http://www.learnangularjs.net/angular5-features.php`]

1. Optimized build :-

 It helps to removed unnecessary code from your application.

`https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/8594`
`http://www.gistia.com/angular-performance-two-strategies/`
 https://blog.angular.io/version-5-0-0-of-angular-now-available-37e414935ced
 http://www.softwarearchitekt.at/post/2017/07/26/shrinking-angular-bundles-with-the-angular-build-optimizer.aspx
 https://angular.io/guide/deployment

 * ng build
 * ng build --prod
 * ng build --prod --named-chunks

 you needed to use the --build-optimizer flag:
  `ng build --prod --build-optimizer`

2. Server transfer State module :-

3. Incremental builds :-

4. Removing White spaces :-

5. Router Life cycle events :-

6. Export alias support :-

7. Lambdas in providers :-

8. Blur and submit events :-

## AOT Compiler
https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler

The Angular Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler converts your Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build phase before the browser downloads and runs that code.

`Angular offers two ways to compile your application:`

`1- Just-in-Time (JIT),` which compiles your app in the browser at runtime, just before the app is run in your browser.

JIT is necessary for the browsers because they themselves do not understand any binaries served to them. Hence once we load the JavaScript file(s), they are compiled to the corresponding binary which can then be interpreted and executed by the browser.


`2- Ahead-of-Time (AOT),` which compiles your app at build time.


`AOT` stands for Ahead of Time compiler, what it does, as the name implies, is to convert all of our TypeScript codes to native JavaScript code to make sure that it will be supported in all browsers. The same was being done by Just In Compiler in the previous version, so what's the difference? AOT converts the code before it runs in the browser, whereas `JIT` converts it at runtime. Hence the page renders faster.

## Why compile with AOT? :
With AOT, the browser downloads a pre-compiled version of the application. The browser loads executable code so it can render the application immediately, without waiting to compile the app first.

## How AOT works :
It helps to think of the AOT compiler as having two phases: a code analysis phase in which it simply records a representation of the source; and a code generation phase in which the compiler's StaticReflector handles the interpretation as well as places restrictions on what it interprets.

`https://scotch.io/@kashyapmukkamala/jit-vs-aot-in-angular2-and-how-to-use-it`

## JIT and AOT in angular2 :

If you are using angular2, the probability of you using TypeScript (TS) along with angular2 is very high. Since majority of the features of TS are still not supported by the browser, we might be relying on tools such as TypeScript compiler. These convert our code from TS to JS first, and then we serve these JS files to the browser (which again compiles the JS files to a binary which they understand).

`So whats the problem again?`

`https://scotch.io/@kashyapmukkamala/jit-vs-aot-in-angular2-and-how-to-use-it`   (good)


Essentially we are compiling the code twice with angular2 apps, once when we convert TS to JS and then when the `browser converts JS to binary`.

## Angular 4 Features : [`https://www.techiediaries.com/angular-4-tutorial/`]

* Size and performance: Angular 4 applications are smaller by hundreds of kilobytes, thanks to the improvements to the View Engine which have reduced the size of generated components code by around 60% .
 * Improved *ngIf and *ngFor: *ngIf now supports the else syntax, for example it's easy now to write templates in this way

 <div *ngIf="ready ; else loading">
    <p>Hello Angular 4</p>
</div>
<ng-template #loading>Still loading</ng-template> 

* You can also assign and use local variables inside both *ngIf and *ngFor expressions, for example:

<div *ngFor="let el of list as users; " >
        { { el } }
</div>

### Create common intput box and use it all over application with different-2 input and placeholder.

`see- main-box.componenet.ts page and input-box.components`

`https://coursetro.com/posts/code/58/Angular-4-Property-Binding-Tutorial` // Property Binding Example

`There are 3 ways to define a `property` binding in Angular:`

  1- <img src="{{ angularLogo }}">
  2- <img [src]="angularLogo">
  3- <img bind-src="angularLogo">

Below is syntex for attribute binding-:
`[attr.maxlength]= 'your value'` // this is syntax for attribute binding

## important difference between property and attribute:?
* Attribute value does not change: 
* Properties does change.

`Property Binding: `Lets assume we want assign if button is disabled or not and we have got isDisabled variable in our class:
<button [disabled]=’isDisabled’>Click</button>
[disabled]=’isDisabled’ // Property Binding:


`Attribute Binding:` Normally Angular recommends to use property binding but if there is not any corresponding property to attribute (for example ‘colspan’).

<th colspan=’{{colSpan}}’> — ->Result will be error.To bind attribute

<th attr.colspan=’{{colSpan}}’> OR → <th [attr.colspan]=’colSpan’>No Error 

Angular allow only property binding not allow attribute binding if no property avaliable for any attribute in element then we have to use like this `attr.colspan` for dinding.


When writing HTML source code, you can define `attributes` on your HTML elements. Then, once the browser parses your code, a corresponding DOM node will be created. This node is an object, and therefore it has properties.


###  Difference in  properties and attributes:-
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6003819/what-is-the-difference-between-properties-and-attributes-in-html


By default angular look property binding. not apply binding property on attributes so to apply binding property also on attributes follow below syntax-:

`[attr.maxlength]= 'your value'` // this is syntax for attribute binding
`[placeholder]="inputPlaceHolder"` // this is syntax for property binding


## Interpolation :- https://coursetro.com/posts/code/108/Angular-5-Interpolation,-Property-Binding-&-Event-Binding-Tutorial

Whenever you need to communicate properties (variables, objects, arrays, etc..) from the component class to the template, you can use interpolation.

`The format for defining interpolation in a template is: {{ propertyName }}`

`<p>Your bucket list ({{ itemCount }})</p>`

## Attribute binding:-
Below is syntax for attribute binding:

`[attr.maxlength]= 'your value'` // this is syntax for attribute binding

## Property Binding : 
if  we want to use the component class to control the property of any element tag  then We can do this through property binding.
 
  itemCount: number = 4;
  `btnText: string = 'Add an Item';`    // Add this line

<!-- From: -->
<input type="submit" class="btn" value="Add Item">

<!-- To: -->
<input type="submit" class="btn" [value]="btnText"> // here we set property binding concept

<!-- Interpolation -->
<input type="submit" class="btn" value="{{ btnText }}"> // same thing using <!-- Interpolation -->

Note-  https://coursetro.com/posts/code/108/Angular-5-Interpolation,-Property-Binding-&-Event-Binding-Tutorial
`Property binding in Angular 5 is one-way, in that communication goes from the component class to the template.`

## Two-Way Data Binding:

What if we wanted to use our input textfield to both retrieve and set its value from a component class? We can use what's called `ngModel` to create that 2-way data binding.

First, we have to import the `FormsModule` in order to have access to ngModule.

import { `FormsModule` } from '@angular/forms';

// Other imports removed for brevity

@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    `FormsModule`             // Add the FormsModule here
  ],

itemCount: number = 4;
  btnText: string = 'Add an Item';
  `goalText`: string = 'My first life goal';    // Add this  it is use to check example of two way data binding.

<!-- From: -->
<input type="text" class="txt" name="item" placeholder="Life goal..">

<!-- To: -->
<input type="text" class="txt" name="item" placeholder="Life goal.." [(ngModel)]="goalText">

<br><span>{{ goalText }}</span><br>

### Event Binding:

https://coursetro.com/posts/code/108/Angular-5-Interpolation,-Property-Binding-&-Event-Binding-Tutorial

<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="myModel" (blur)="onBlurMethod()">

export class AppComponent { 
  myModel: any;
  constructor(){
    this.myModel = '123';
  }
  `onBlurMethod`(){
   alert(this.myModel); 
  }
}

`Alternative(not preferable)`

<input type="text" #input (blur)="onBlurMethod($event.target.value)">

## Types of Event Binding :
`https://coursetro.com/posts/code/59/Angular-4-Event-Binding`

Whenever you wish to capture an event from the view, you do so by wrapping the event in question with ( ) parenthesis.
Angular provides you with a variety of events from which you can call component logic.
Here are examples of the most common events that you can use for event binding:

(focus)="myMethod()"  // An element has received focus
(blur)="myMethod()"   // An element has lost focus

(submit)="myMethod()"  // A submit button has been pressed

(scroll)="myMethod()"

(cut)="myMethod()"
(copy)="myMethod()"
(paste)="myMethod()"

(keydown)="myMethod()"
(keypress)="myMethod()"
(keyup)="myMethod()"

(mouseenter)="myMethod()"
(mousedown)="myMethod()"
(mouseup)="myMethod()"

(click)="myMethod()"
(dblclick)="myMethod()"

(drag)="myMethod()"
(dragover)="myMethod()"
(drop)="myMethod()"

* IN react js in one time only one tag will return at a time not return multi tag.
and inside that single tag we canuse multiple tag
<section>

</section> // only return
</section></sectinon> //not return

* in react tag we need to clod=se input tag
<input type="text" />  -- correct
<input type="text"> -- not correct

* instead of class we have to use className:
<div class=""></div> -- not correct
<div className=""></div> -- this is correct

* we cans use js code  inside {}
get(){
  return abhi;
}
<div className="red">{this.get()}</div>

* in each constructor we need to create supper: this is use to inherihit all method and propertie from another class.

constructor(){
  supper();
  this.name ="abhi";
}

<div className="red">{this.name}</div>
* State and Props in ReactJS:
constructor(){
  supper();
  this.state{
    name ="abhi";
  }
}

<div className="red">{this.state.name}</div>


* this.props is use to find vale
if we want to give value to child element then we can use this.props

* this.setState({}):

* render function once for each function:

*  react js use virtual DOM
 
* we need react and react dom

* CSS with ReactJS using TypeStyle:

/***********another component***************************************************
---------------------sets and map-----------------------------------------------
* Map is a collection of keyed data items, just like an Object. But the main difference is that `Map allows keys of any type.`

Methods and properties are:

new Map() – creates the map.
map.set(key, value) – stores the value by the key.
map.get(key) – returns the value by the key, undefined if key doesn’t exist in map.
map.has(key) – returns true if the key exists, false otherwise.
map.delete(key) – removes the value by the key.
map.clear() – removes everything from the map.
map.size – returns the current element count.

let map = new Map();

map.set('1', 'str1');   // a string key
map.set(1, 'num1');     // a numeric key
map.set(true, 'bool1'); // a boolean key

// remember the regular Object? it would convert keys to string
// Map keeps the type, so these two are different:
alert( map.get(1)   ); // 'num1'
alert( map.get('1') ); // 'str1'

alert( map.size ); // 3
`As we can see, unlike objects, keys are not converted to strings. Any type of key is possible.`

## Iteration over Map

For looping over a map, there are 3 methods:

map.keys() – returns an iterable for keys,
map.values() – returns an iterable for values,
map.entries() – returns an iterable for entries [key, value], it’s used by default in for..of.

let recipeMap = new Map([
  ['cucumber', 500],
  ['tomatoes', 350],
  ['onion',    50]
]);

// iterate over keys (vegetables)
for (let vegetable of recipeMap.keys()) {
  alert(vegetable); // cucumber, tomatoes, onion
}

## Set:
A Set is a special type collection – “set of values” (without keys), where each value may occur only once.


--------------------------ng build or ng build --dev-------------------------------
-->> by default  ng build or ng build --dev command is development commonad not production command
-->> ng build --prod is use for production build
-->> ng server only use to run application on my local machine
* Compiles and serves the appication from the memory
* does not write build files to the disk
* used to run the applicationon local development machine
* can not used for deploying the build to another server
* 

ng-build: (ng-build or ng-build --dev) and ng-build --prod
* compiles the application to the dist folder
* can be used to produce the both development andproduction build
* typically used to deploye the application on another server
* 

1- production build file size are less than Dev build file sizes
2- production build does not generate source .map file only dev build generate .map file
3- production build extract css from global styles onto css file instead of js only dev build extract css from js file 
means style.js file not created in case of --prod build

---------------------------------package.json and package-lock.json---------------------------------
* dependencies: this section is use for prod development
* devdependencies: this is use for develoment process

package.json:> in this file version display which are required for project to run

package-lock.json:> in this file version display which are install in my system. and that file downloaded inside node
-module folder


^ - this is use to check if upper version minor version avaliable or not 
~ - this is use to check revision veriosn and install higher revision version.

1.6.5 :

1- this is majer change
6- this is minor change
5- revision version change

--------------------------------- Obserabel map()--------------------------------

map() - this operater is use to transform obserabele input data in another form and return out put as obserable and to get that 
transform data we have to subscribe this.

If we will get array data and we want only name then use map to transform data.

--------------------------constractor and ngOnInit------------------------------------------
1- constructor is use to create instance of any class which are use in component.
2- constructor is part of typeScript.
3- constructor excute befor ngOnInit
4- Any dependency and be use inside only constractor.
5- we can not use `input/output` inside constructor because this is not part of typescript  it will return undefined

1- ngOnInit is part of Angular life cycle hook
2- 

----------------------------map and set--------------------------------------------------

https://howtodoinjava.com/typescript/maps/

Map is a new data structure introduced in ES6. It allows you store key-value pairs same as object.
but in case of object  typeof key is always is string but in case of map key may be any type like as string,number,boolean etc.

let myMap = new Map();

let nameAgeMapping = new Map();
 
//Set entries
nameAgeMapping.set("Lokesh", 37);
nameAgeMapping.set("Raj", 35);
nameAgeMapping.set("John", 40);
 //Get entries
nameAgeMapping.get("John");     //40
 
//Check entry is present or not
nameAgeMapping.has("Lokesh");       //true
nameAgeMapping.has("Brian");        //false
 
//Size of Map with 
nameAgeMapping.size;                //3




## Set is a new data structure introduced in ES6, similar to Map. It allows you store distinct values into a List. set store only distinct values means we can not store same type of value multiple times.

https://codecraft.tv/courses/angular/es6-typescript/mapset/

https://howtodoinjava.com/typescript/maps/

set store only value not store key-value paire like as map.
because map store key-value pairs.

let set = new Set()
    .add('APPLE')
    .add('ORANGE')
    .add('MANGO');

    let set = new Set(['APPLE', 'ORANGE', 'MANGO']);

## tsconfig.json – TypeScript Compiler Configuration?
TypeScript compiler uses `tsconfig.json` to get configuration options for generating JavaScript code from TypeScript sourcecode.

##  what is undeclare and undefined ?
`Undefined:` It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned with any value. Undefined is not a keyword.

`Undeclared:` It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier `using var or const keyword.` If we use ‘typeof’ operator to get the value of an undeclared variable, we will face the runtime error with return value as `“undefined”`. The scope of the undeclared variables is always global.

## what is use of polyfile.js?
https://izifortune.com/angular-polyfill-strategies/

Polyfills in angular are few lines of code which make your application compatible for different browsers.

An Angular application created with the angular-cli contain the file src/polyfills.ts. The file highlight the different modules that might be needed for a specific browser in order to work properly.

We will import all required module in side `polyfills.ts` which are required to load application on browser.

## what is diff in promice and obserable?
 .debounceTime(500)
 .distinctUntilChanged()
 due to this we can cancle request due to this we can not make call on server for every type in case of search.
 and this makes diff in promice and obserable;because in promice we can not cancle request and in canse of promice we will hit on server for every request

 * both obserable and promice work with asynchrous request to get data from api server
 * promice work with asynchrous request and return a single value this is resolve or an error.
 * another this is whatever we will initiated from a promice is not cancellable.
 * Promises work with asynchronous operations and they either return us a single value (i.e. the promise resolves) or an error message (i.e. the promise rejects).
 * Another important thing to remember regarding promises is that a request initiated from a promise is not cancellable. 


 ` Problems in promice?`
 * What if I want to canclea request to the API ?
 * What if I want to retry a faild call?
 * for bigger project very hard to manage promice

` What we can do with obserable?`

* We can cancle request so that we can not make call on server for every request
* We can retry call server api if some time server api faild during call due to some reason
* there are multiple operator which are use with Obserable likes as  .map(), delay(),`.debounceTime(500)`
 .distinctUntilChanged(), retry(), replay(), delay(), etc which are use handle with obserable based on requirement.
 * we will use subscribe to get data from data sourece.

`retry()` -- retry()is the method name which are use in obserable to call api again if appi faild first time due to any reason  but in case of promice if api fail first time due to any reason then in that case promice will not call api again and it will return error or reject.

`.debounceTime(500)` -- .debounceTime(500) is the method whic are use in obserable to cancle previous request in obserable but in case of promice we can not cancle previous request.


## Obserable and Subscribe?
 both obserable and promice work with asynchrous request to get data from api server and it obserabe request and responce data and to use responce data from api on page we have to Subscribe that responce.

Obserable responsiblity to check request and responce and based on request it retur responce.
Obserable belongs to RxJs library to work with asynchrous programing in angular we can use Obserable or Promice.

ElementRef is simply a like document.getElementById('myId');
by ElementRef you can only able to do some decorations
* It’s useful for accessing native DOM element

## More details about--> ng-content, ng-contener, ng-template , example in student-registration component.

* `ng-content and Content Projection-->> `

https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-ng-content/

One of the Angular features that help us the most in `building reusable components` is Content Projection and ng-content

 You use the <ng-content></ng-content> tag as a placeholder for that dynamic content, then when the template is parsed Angular will replace that placeholder tag with your content.

 The technical term for this is `“content projection"` because you are projecting content from the parent component into the designated child component.

 * ng-content is use to use componenet htlml inside the another component with same design
 * ng-content by this we can use particular html section from another component inside another componet
 * 

 They are used to create configurable components. This means the components can be configured depending on the needs of its user. This is well known as Content Projection. Components that are used in published libraries make use of <ng-content> to make themselves configurable.

`What Problem is Content Projection Trying to Solve?`

<ng-content> is used for projecting content into components. Any component that will accept other components between its opening and closing tags will use an <ng-content> to indicate where that content should be placed.
If we create a `SomeComponent component`, we can indicate that it can take projected content by using the <ng-content> tag to indicate where the projected content should go.

<h1>Above the projected content</h1>
<ng-content></ng-content>
<p>Below the projected content</p>

And then wherever we use SomeComponent, we can insert any template elements between its opening and closing tags as the projected content.

<some-component>
 <h3>I am the projected content!</h3>
</some-component>

 if we want to include some content extra inside the resuable component then in that case we have to use <ng-content>. (check label-text.component insdie the frameinfo component)

Actually, they're very easy to implement. What we need to do is to associate a property in each call for the component, and then give that property to the place where we want to project that piece of code.

First, let's go and change the code inside our article component. We will have several projections, which will look different from the attributes. The code should look like this:


* Allow only no. or allow only string.  (check only-number.directive, only-string.directive, main-box.componet file)

* count no. of integer in given string no. combination  (\app\javascript\New folder\main.js file)



* `ng-template -->>` 
As the name suggests the <ng-template> is a template element that Angular uses with structural directives (*ngIf, *ngFor, [ngSwitch] and custom directives).

These template elements only work in the presence of structural directives. 

* <ng-template> :
https://www.angularjswiki.com/angular/what-is-ng-template-in-angular/

<div> ng-template works!</div>
<ng-template>Inside ng-template tag</ng-template>

If you see the output it will display only `ng-template` works which is in <div> element.And have a look at the generated HTML source code.

 1- <ng-template> is a virtual element and its contents are displayed only when needed (based on conditions).
 2-  <ng-template> should be used along with structural directives like `[ngIf],[ngFor],[NgSwitch]` or custom structural directives.That is why in the above example the contents of <ng-template> are not displayed.

It means <ng-template> will work only with structural directives like `[ngIf],[ngFor],[NgSwitch]` or custom structural directives. without structural directives <ng-template> will not work.

And we will use <ng-template> in code when we need to display any contant on page but no need to display any tag inside DOM then in that case we will use <ng-template>.

another things is when we need to use two structural directive at same time then in that case we can use <ng-template> because if we will use another input element then it will display in DOM but <ng-template> will not display in DOM.


<div>
   <span *ngIf = "isavailable;then condition1 else condition2">Condition is valid.</span>
   <ng-template #condition1>Condition is valid from template</ng-template>
   <ng-template #condition2>Condition is invalid from template</ng-template>
</div>


* `ng-contener -->>` 
this is work as same as `ng-template` but `ng-contener` use without any structural directives (*ngIf, *ngFor, [ngSwitch] and custom directives).

`ng-contener` use if we need to multiple structureal directuive on same div.

* `*ngTemplateOutlet  -->>`
They are used as a container to templates that can be reused at multiple places. We will cover more on this in a later section of this article.

it means if we have <ng-templat> and we want to use this inside multiple <ng-contener> then in that case we have to use `*ngTemplateOutlet` inside the <ng-container>

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ng-template-ng-content-ng-container-and-ngtemplateoutlet-4b7b51223691/


## why we are using typeScript while having JavaScript?

## Template reference?

We can access DOM propertis.
A template reference variable is often a reference to a DOM element within a template. 
You declare a reference variable by using the hash symbol (#). The `#firstNameInput` declares a `firstNameInput` variable on an <input> element.

<input type="text" #firstNameInput>
<input type="text" #lastNameInput>

After that, you can access the variable anywhere inside the template. For example, I pass the variable as a parameter on an event.
<button (click)="show(lastNameInput)">Show</button>

Remember that the lastNameInput belongs to `HTMLInputElement` type.

I told you that you cannot access that template reference variable inside the component class or typescript logic but still, you can use that variable by passing it through a method which will be called by the event listener.

show(lastName: `HTMLInputElement`){
    console.log(lastName.value);
}

http://www.writesomecode.in/Angular/Using-Template-Reference-Variables-In-Angular7  (best)

<div>
<label for="Name">Name</label>
<input type="text" #nameInput>
<button (click)="onSaveName(nameInput)">Save Name</button>
</div>
onSaveName(name: `HTMLInputElement`) {
    console.log(( < HTMLInputElement > name).value);
  }

There is one more way to accessing the template reference variable is using `@ViewChild()` decorator, using this decorator, we can reference that variable inside our component without passing it via method as a parameter, or we can say, if we need to access it before the onSaveName() method get executed.  

@ViewChild('`nameInput`') inputNameRef: `ElementRef`;

onSaveName(name: HTMLInputElement) {
    console.log(( < HTMLInputElement > name).value);
    console.log(this.inputNameRef.nativeElement.value);
  }
  `ngAfterViewChecked`() {
    console.log("After view got Checked");
    console.log(`this.inputNameRef.nativeElement.value`);
  }

Don’t forget that with the `@ViewChild()` decorator, our reference to the variable will be `ElementRef` type Since we are trying to access a reference to an element of our template view. `ElementRef` has sub-property called nativeElement which wraps all the underlying properties of that specific referenced element.

We can also get the value of input within the same template by placing a reference variable over it.

<input type="text" (change)="true" #groupRef >
{{groupRef.value}}

A template reference variable is a way of capturing a reference to a specific element, component or directive so that it can be used somewhere else in the same template. 



--------------------------------------TypeScript logic----------------------------------------------

https://www.javatpoint.com/typescript-function-overloading

## TypeScript Tutorial:

TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript development, which can be executed on any browser, any Host, and any Operating System. TypeScript is not directly run on the browser. It needs a compiler to compile and generate in JavaScript file.

TypeScript is an open-source pure object-oriented programing language. It is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to plain JavaScript

TypeScript cannot run directly on the browser. It needs a compiler to compile the file and generate it in JavaScript file, which can run directly on the browser. The TypeScript source file is in ".ts" extension. We can use any valid ".js" file by renaming it to ".ts" file. `TypeScript uses TSC (TypeScript Compiler) compiler,` which convert Typescript code (.ts file) to JavaScript (.js file). 

## Why use TypeScript?
 We use TypeScript because of the following benefits.
 * TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, generics, etc.
 * TypeScript support reusability because of the inheritance.
 * TypeScript supports Static typing, Strongly type, Modules, Optional Parameters, etc.

 # class: 
 Classes are used to create reusable components and acts as a template for creating objects. It is a logical entity which store variables and functions to perform operations. TypeScript gets support for classes from ES6. It is different from the interface which has an implementation inside it, whereas an interface does not have any implementation inside it.

 ## Interface:
 It is use to define object ,variable with data type and that we can use this inside the class.  interface does not have any implementation inside it.

## Generic:
Generic is used to create a component which can work with a variety of data type rather than a single one.
TypeScript uses generics with the type variable <T> that denotes types.

function identity<T>(arg: T): T {  
    return arg;  
}  
let output1 = identity<string>("myString");  
let output2 = identity<number>( 100 );  

## Touple:
The Tuple is a data type which includes two sets of values of different data types. It allows us to express an array where the type of a fixed number of elements is known, but they are not the same. For example, if we want to represent a value as a pair of a number and a string, then it can be written as:
// Declare a tuple  
let a: [string, number];  
  
// Initialize it  
a = ["hi", 8, "how", 5]; // OK 

We know that an array holds multiple values of the same data type. But sometimes, we may need to store a collection of values of different data types in a single variable. Arrays will not provide this feature, but TypeScript has a data type called `Tuple` to achieve this purpose.

A `Tuple` is an array which store multiple fields belong to different data types. 


## Difference between Null and Undefined:

Null: Null is used to represent an intentional absence of value. It represents a variable whose value is undefined. It accepts only one value, which is null.

//Variable declared and assigned to null  
var a = null;   
console.log( a );   //output: null  
console.log( typeof(a) );   //output: object  

Undefined: `It represents uninitialized variables in TypeScript and JavaScript. `It has only one value, which is undefined. The undefined keyword defines the undefined type in TypeScript, but it is not useful because we can only assign an undefined value to it.

//Variable declaration without assigning any value to it  
var a;        
console.log(a);  //undefined  
console.log(typeof(a));  //undefined  
console.log(undeclaredVar);  //Uncaught ReferenceError: `undeclaredVar` is not defined  


## Difference between let and var keyword


* Variable declared with var keyword can be re-declared and updated in the same scope.
function varGreeter(){
  var a = 10;        
  var a = 20; //a is replaced
  console.log(a);
}
varGreeter();

* Variable declared with let keyword can be updated but not re-declared.
function varGreeter(){
  let a = 10;        
 let a = 20; //SyntaxError: 
 //Identifier 'a' has already been declared
  console.log(a);
}
varGreeter();

* It is hoisted.
{
  console.log(c); // undefined. 
  //Due to hoisting
  var c = 2;
}

* It is not hoisted.
Example:
{
  console.log(b); // ReferenceError: 
  //b is not defined
  let b = 3;
}

## TypeScript Type Inference:

## TypeScript Arrays:

## TypeScript Union:
In TypeScript, we can define a variable which can have multiple types of values. In other words, TypeScript can combine one or two different types of data (i.e., number, string, etc.) in a single type, which is called a union type. 

` Two or more data types can be combined by using the pipe ('|') symbol between the types.`

`let value: number|string;  `
value = 120;  
console.log("The Numeric value of a value is: "+value);  
value = "Welcome to JavaTpoint";  
console.log("The String value of a value is: "+value);  

## Passing Union Type in Function Parameter:

In function, we can pass a union type as a parameter. We can understand it from the below example.
`function display(value: (number | string))  `
{  
    if(typeof(value) === "number")  
        console.log('The given value is of type number.');  
    else if(typeof(value) === "string")  
        console.log('The given value is of type string.');  
}  
display(123);  
display("ABC");  

## Passing Union Type to Arrays:
TypeScript allows passing a union type to an array. We can understand it from the below example.

`let arrType: number[] | string[];`

arrType = [1,2,3,4];  
arrType = ["India","America","England"];  
console.log("String type array:") 

## TypeScript String:

## TypeScript Access Modifiers:

Typescript allows us to use access modifiers at the class level. It gives direct access control to the class member. These class members are functions and properties. We can use class members inside its own class, anywhere outside the class, or within its child or derived class.


The access modifier increases the security of the class members and prevents them from invalid use. We can also use it to control the visibility of data members of a class. If the class does not have to be set any access modifier, TypeScript automatically sets public access modifier to all class members.


The TypeScript access modifiers are of three types. These are:

`1- Public:`
In TypeScript by default, all the members (properties and methods) of a class are public. So, there is no need to prefix members with this keyword. We can access this data member anywhere without any restriction.

`2- Private:`
The private access modifier cannot be accessible outside of its containing class. It ensures that the class members are visible only to that class in which it is containing.

`3- Protected.:`
A Protected access modifier can be accessed only within the class and its subclass. We cannot access it from the outside of a class in which it is containing



https://www.javatpoint.com/typescript-access-modifiers


## TypeScript Accessor:
## TypeScript Arrow function:

## TypeScript Function Overloading: Function overloading is also known as method overloading

`Function overloading is a mechanism or ability to create multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types and return type.` However, it can have the same number of parameters.

The Function/Method overloading is allowed when:

The function name is the same
The number of parameters is different in each overloaded function.
The number of parameters is the same, and their type is different.
The all overloads function must have the same return type.

## Advantage of function overloading:
It saves the memory space so that program execution becomes fast.
It provides code reusability, which saves time and efforts.


## TypeScript Function Parameter:
We can categorize the function parameter into the three types:
* `Optional Parameter:`
TypeScript introduces optional parameter. We can use optional parameters by using the question mark sign `('?')`. It means that the parameters which may or may not receive a value can be appended with a "?" sign to mark them as optional. 

function function_name(parameter1[:type], parameter2[:type], parameter3 ? [:type]) { }  


* `Default Parameter:`
TypeScript provides an option to set default values to the function parameters. If the user does not pass a value to an argument, TypeScript initializes the default value for the parameter. The behavior of the default parameter is the same as an optional parameter.

However, if a function signature has a default parameter before a required parameter, we can still call a function which marks the default parameter is passed as an undefined value.

function function_name(parameter1[:type], parameter2[:type] = default_value) { }  

`We cannot make the parameter default and optional at the same time.`

* `Rest Parameter: `
It is used to pass zero or more values to a function. We can declare it by prefixing the three "dot" characters ('...') before the parameter.It allows the functions to have a different number of arguments without using the arguments object. 
`The rest parameter is useful, where we have an undetermined number of parameters.`

`Rules to follow in rest parameter:`
* We can use only one rest parameter in a function.
* It must be an array type.
* It must be the last parameter in a parameter list.

function function_name(parameter1[:type], parameter2[:type], ...parameter[:type]) { } 

function sum(`a: number, ...b: number[]`): number {  
  let result = a;  
  for (var i = 0; i < b.length; i++) {  
  result += b[i];  
  }  
  return result;  
}  
let result1 = sum(3, 5);  
let result2 = sum(3, 5, 7, 9);  
console.log(result1 +"\n" + result2);  

## TypeScript Classes:

classes are the fundamental entities which are used to create reusable components. It is a group of objects which have common properties. In terms of OOPs, a class is a template or blueprint for creating objects. It is a logical entity.

A class definition can contain the following properties:

`Fields:` It is a variable declared in a class.
`Methods:` It represents an action for the object.
`Constructors: `It is responsible for initializing the object in memory.
`Nested class and interface:` It means a class can contain another class.


TypeScript is an Object-Oriented JavaScript language, so it supports object-oriented programming features like classes, interfaces, polymorphism, data-binding, etc. JavaScript ES5 or earlier version did not support classes. TypeScript support this feature from ES6 and later version. 

TypeScript is an Object-Oriented JavaScript language, so it supports object-oriented programming features like classes, interfaces, polymorphism, data-binding, etc. JavaScript ES5 or earlier version did not support classes. TypeScript support this feature from ES6 and later version. 

## TypeScript Inheritance:
https://www.javatpoint.com/typescript-inheritance
 TypeScript supports only `single and multilevel inheritance`. It doesn't support multiple, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance.

Before ES6, JavaScript uses functions and `prototype-based inheritance`, but TypeScript supports the `class-based inheritance` which comes from ES6 version. 


It is a mechanism which acquires the `properties` and `behaviors` of a class from another class. The class whose members are inherited is called the `base class`, and the class that inherits those members is called the `derived/child/subclass`. In child class, we can override or modify the behaviors of its parent class.

The TypeScript uses class inheritance through the `extends` keyword. TypeScript supports only `single inheritance` and `multilevel inheritance`. 

## TypeScript Interface:
The interface contains only the declaration of the methods and fields, but not the implementation. We cannot use it to build anything. It is inherited by a class, and the class which implements interface defines all members of the interface.

`When the Typescript compiler compiles it into JavaScript, then the interface will be disappeared from the JavaScript file. Thus, its purpose is to help in the development stage only.`

We can exted multiple interfacee at same time like as below:

interface `Person` {   
   name:string  
   age:number  
}  
interface `Employee` extends `Person` {   
   gender:string  
   empCode:number  
}  
Let us take the above example, which helps us to understand the multiple interface inheritance.

interface `Person` {   
   name:string    
}  
interface `PersonDetail` {   
    age:number  
    gender:string  
}  
interface `Employee` extends `Person`, `PersonDetail` {   
    empCode:number  
}

## TypeScript Namespaces:
https://www.javatpoint.com/typescript-namespaces

The namespace is a way which is used for logical grouping of functionalities.
A namespace is also known as internal modules. A namespace can also include interfaces, classes, functions, and variables to support a group of related functionalities.

We can create a namespace by using the namespace keyword followed by the namespace_name. All the `interfaces`, `classes`, `functions`, and `variables` can be defined in the curly braces{} by using the export keyword. The export keyword makes each component accessible to outside the namespaces. We can declare the namespace as below.

Unlike JavaScript, namespaces are inbuilt into TypeScript. In JavaScript, the variables declarations go into the global scope. If the multiple JavaScript files are used in the same project, then there will be a possibility of confusing new users by overwriting them with a similar name. Hence, the use of TypeScript namespace removes the naming collisions.

namespace <namespace_name> {  
               export interface I1 { }  
               export class c1{ }  
}  

To access the interfaces, classes, functions, and variables in another namespace, we can use the following syntax.

namespaceName.className;  
namespaceName.functionName; 

## TypeScript Module:

A module is a way to create a group of related variables, functions, classes, and interfaces, etc. `It executes in the local scope, not in the global scope. In other words, the variables, functions, classes, and interfaces declared in a module cannot be accessible outside the module directly.`

`We can create a module by using the export keyword and can use in other modules by using the import keyword.`

We can divide the module into two categories:

`1- Internal Module`
`2- External Module`


A module is a way to create a group of related `variables`, `functions`, `classes`, and `interfaces`, etc. It executes in the `local scope`, not in the `global scope`. In other words, the `variables`, `functions`, `classes`, and `interfaces` declared in a module cannot be accessible outside the module directly. We can create a module by using the export keyword and can use in other modules by using the `import` keyword.

for example we have created app.module.ts and use export to create module name. now to use this module
we  have imported `app.module` inside the `main.ts` file.


## Module vs. Namespace:

`Module Declaration:`

export class `Addition`{
    constructor(private x?: number, private y?: number){
    }
    Sum(){
        console.log("SUM: " +(this.x + this.y));
    }
}
`Accessing Modules:`

import {`Addition`} from './addition';
let addObject = new Addition(10, 20); 
addObject.Sum();

`Namespace Declaration:`

FileName: StoreCalc.ts
namespace `invoiceCalc` { 
   export namespace invoiceAccount { 
      export class Invoice { 
         public calculateDiscount(price: number) { 
            return price * .60; 
         } 
      } 
   } 
}

`Accessing Namespace:`

///<reference path="./StoreCalc.ts"/>
let invoice = new `invoiceCalc`.invoiceAccount.Invoice(); 
console.log("Output: "" +invoice.calculateDiscount(400));


## TypeScript Generics:

TypeScript Generics is a tool which provides a way to create reusable components.  It creates a component that can work with a variety of data types rather than a single data type. It allows users to consume these components and use their own types.

In generics, we need to write a type parameter between the `open (<) and close (>) brackets`, which makes it strongly typed collections. Generics use a special kind of type variable` <T> `that denotes types. The generics collections contain only similar types of objects



function `identity`<T>(arg: T): T {    
    return arg;    
}    
let output1 = `identity`<string>("myString");    
let output2 = `identity`<number>( 100 );  
console.log(output1);  
console.log(output2);  

## Advantage of Generics:

## Why need Generics?:
https://www.javatpoint.com/typescript-generics

function getItems<T>(items : T[] ) : T[] {  
    return new Array<T>().concat(items);  
}  
let arrNumber = getItems<number>([10, 20, 30]);  
let arrString = getItems<string>(["Hello", "JavaTpoint"]);  
arrNumber.push(40); // Correct  
arrNumber.push("Hi! Javatpoint"); // Compilation Error  
arrString.push("Hello TypeScript"); // Correct  
arrString.push(50); // Compilation Error  
console.log(arrNumber);  
console.log(arrString);

## Multi-type variables in TypeScript Generics:
In TypeScript Generics, we can define multi-type variables with a different name. We can understand it with the following example.

function displayDataType<T, U>(id:T, name:U): void {   
  console.log("DataType of Id: "+typeof(id) + "\nDataType of Name: "+ typeof(name));    
}  
displayDataType<number, string>(101, "Abhishek");  

## Generic with non-generic Type:
function displayDataType<T>(id:T, name:string): void {   
  console.log("DataType of Id: "+typeof(id) + "\nDataType of Name: "+ typeof(name));    
}  
displayDataType<number>(1, "Abhishek");  




## Typescript Compilation Context:

https://www.javatpoint.com/typescript-compilation-context

`1- tsconfig.json:` The tsconfig.json file is a file which is in JSON format. In the `tsconfig.json` file, we can specify various options which tell the compiler how to compile the current project.

The tsconfig. json file allows you to specify the root level files and the compiler options that requires to compile a TypeScript project.

 * Include and Exclude properties: An include and exclude properties allows us to take an array pattern to add  or remove a list of TypeScript files from the compilation process.
 "include": [  
        "src/**/*"  
    ],  
    "exclude": [  
        "node_modules",  
        "**/*.spec.ts"  
    ]
    let v1: any = false
let v2: boolean = v1;

console.log ('fdfd', v2);

## Difference in attribute and property?

https://javascript.info/dom-attributes-and-properties

When writing HTML source code, you can define attributes on your HTML elements. Then, once the browser parses your code, a corresponding DOM node will be created. This node is an object, and therefore it has properties means property create for each attribute with same name.

If property not avaliable for any attribute then DOM not create property for that attribute.

For instance, this HTML element:

<input type="text" value="Name:"> has 2 attributes (type and value).

When a DOM node is created for a given HTML element, many of its properties relate to attributes with the same or similar names, but it's not a one-to-one relationship. For instance, for this HTML element

<input id="the-input" type="text" value="Name:">

the corresponding DOM node will have id,type, and value properties (among others):

* The id property is a reflected property for the id attribute: Getting the property reads the attribute value, and setting the property writes the attribute value. id is a pure reflected property, it doesn't modify or limit the value.


When the browser loads the page, it “reads” (another word: “parses”) the HTML and generates DOM objects from it. For element nodes, most standard HTML attributes automatically become properties of DOM objects means if for any attribute if property avaliable in with same name then it will create DOM property for that attribute with same attribute name.

For instance, if the tag is <body id="page">, then the DOM object has body.id="page".

In HTML, tags may have attributes. When the browser parses the HTML to create DOM objects for tags, `it recognizes standard attributes and creates DOM properties from them.`

So when an element has id or another standard attribute, the corresponding property gets created. `But that doesn’t happen if the attribute is non-standard then for non-standard attribute DOM will not create property.`

<body id="test" something="non-standard">
  <script>
    alert(document.body.id); // test
    // non-standard attribute does not yield a property
    alert(document.body.something); // undefined
  </script>
</body>

Please note that a standard attribute for one element can be unknown for another one. For instance, "type" is standard for <input> (HTMLInputElement), but not for <body> (HTMLBodyElement). Standard attributes are described in the specification for the corresponding element class.

<body id="body" type="...">
  <input id="input" type="text">
  <script>
    alert(input.type); // text
    alert(body.type); // undefined: DOM property not created, because it's non-standard
  </script>
</body>

`So, if an attribute is non-standard, there won’t be a DOM-property for it. Is there a way to access such attributes?`

`so to access such attributes(non-standard) we will use [attr-attrbuteName]`

## what is DOM?

D-(Document): html page
O(Object)-: elements and attribute in your html page
M(Model)-: in DOM tree structure of HTML elements

`when html page load in browser then browser created tree structure arrangement of elements and attribute for html page  which is call DOM.`

`DOM is W3 standered to understand the structure of HTML page so that we can create, read, update, delete, manage,DOM elements using JavaScript or JQuery DOM method.`



DOM is a way to represent the webpage in the structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmers and users to glide through the document. With DOM, we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, Attributes or Elements using commands or methods provided by Document object.

Attributes – is what’s written in HTML.
Properties – is what’s in DOM objects

###  APP_INITIALIZER ->  check inside the app.module.ts 

https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-use-the-app-initializer-token-to-hook-into

https://github.com/sagar-ganatra/angular-app-initializer   (code example)
 
https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-how-to-use-app-initializer/

 * APP_INITIALIZER is "a function that will be executed when an application is initialized." 
 * In this case, We will can some API based on requirement and the remote API is resolved first and then the application continues with the bootstrap process.

  Here's an example of how the `APP_INITIALIZER` token is included in the application. The main module of the application,` app.module.ts`, includes the `APP_INITIALER` in its providers section:

import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule, `APP_INITIALIZER` } from '@angular/core';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [
    {
      `provide`: `APP_INITIALIZER`,
      `useFactory`: `initApp`,
      multi: true
    }
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }

Notice that the providers section includes `APP_INITIALIZER` with the attribute `useFactory`, referring to factory function `initApp`. Here's the definition of the `initApp` factory function:

export function `initApp`() {
  return () => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('In initApp');
        resolve();
      }, 3000);
    });
  };
}

The factory function is expected to return a Promise and only after the promise has resolved will the application bootstrap process continue.

The factory function is expected to return a Promise and only after the promise has resolved will the application bootstrap process continue. In the above code snippet, a delay of three seconds is added before the promise resolves. This blocks the bootstrapping of the application for three seconds. Similarly, you could use an HTTP service (from HttpClient) to request data from an API and only after the request is complete that the application bootstrap process would continue. However, to use Angular's HttpClient in the initApp factory function, include  HttpClientModule in the imports section and also specify HttpClient as a dependency ( deps) to the APP_INITIALIZER provider:


imports: [
  BrowserModule,
  HttpClientModule
],
providers: [{
 ` provide: APP_INTIALIZER,`
  `useFactory: initApp,`
  multi: true,
  `deps: [HttpClient]`
}]

Next, update the  initiApp factory function and use the instance of HttpClient to request data from a remote service:

export function initApp(http: HttpClient) {
  return () => {
    return http.get('https://api.github.com/users/sagar-ganatra')
      .toPromise()
      .then((resp) => {
        console.log('Response 1 - ', resp);
      });
  };
}

The Angular will execute the function provided by this token when the application loads. If the function returns the promise, then the angular will wait until the promise is resolved. This will make it ideal place to perform some initialization logic before the application is initialized.

As mentioned earlier, the `APP_INITIALIZER` is run when the application is initialized. The Angular suspends the app initialization until all the functions provided by the `APP_INITIALIZER` are run. If any of those intializers return a `promise`, then the angular waits for it to `resolve`, before continuing with the App initialization


This gives us an opportunity to hook into the initialization process and run some our application custom logic. You can load runtime configuration information. load important data from the backend etc.


* If you return reject from the service, the angular app will not start.


2- How to Use Change Detection in Angular?
https://blog.angular-university.io/how-does-angular-2-change-detection-really-work/

https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-use-change-detection-in-angular

Change Detection means updating the DOM whenever data is changed. Angular provides two strategies for Change Detection.

In its default strategy, whenever any data is mutated or changed, Angular will run the change detector to update the DOM. In the onPush strategy, Angular will only run the change detector  when a new reference is passed to @Input() data.

To update the DOM with updated data, Angular provides its own change detector to each component, which is responsible for detecting change and updating the DOM.
