How many way we can create object--

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
The values are written as key : value pairs (key and value separated by a colon).

var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};



Creating a JavaScript Object-----


1- Define and create a single object, using an object literal.
2- Define and create a single object, with the keyword new.
3- Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.


In ECMAScript 5, an object can also be created with the function Object.create().


1- Using an Object Literal --

Using an object literal, you both define and create an object in one statement.

An object literal is a list of key:value pairs (like age:50) inside curly braces {}.


var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};


or --

var person = {firstName:"John", 2:"Doe", 'age':50, 'eyeColor':"blue"};
 we can pas key like above.




2-  Using the JavaScript Keyword new--

The following example also creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:

var person = new Object();
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue";


The two examples above do exactly the same. There is no need to use new Object().
For simplicity, readability and execution speed, use the first one (the object literal method). It means if we create object using new Object(); then it decrease the speed also not easy to read if i have to create long object



3-  Using an Object Constructor ---


The examples above are limited in many situations. They only create a single object.and static object.
Sometimes we like to have an "object type" that can be used to create many objects of one type.


function person(first, last, age, eye) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eye;
}

Once you have an object constructor, you can create new objects of the same type:


var myFather = new person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
var myMother = new person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");
