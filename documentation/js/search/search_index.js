Since ABCX is not considered a special string, the server replies very quickly and our app sets the suggestions for ABCX.\nA few seconds later, however, the server finally replies with the response for the ABC string, and our app receives that response and sets the search suggestions for ABC, overwriting the suggestions for the ABCX string, even though the request for that actually came afterwards.\nHere is a simple diagram to illustrate the issue:\n\n// A1: Request for `ABC`\n\n// A2: Response for `ABC`\n\n// B1: Request for `ABCX`\n\n// B2: Response for `ABCX`\n\n--A1----------A2-->\n\n------B1--B2------>\n\nYou can see that A2 arrives after B2 even though the A1 request began first. This will end up showing the wrong results to the user. \"If the last input in the search was ABCX why am I seeing the results for ABC?\" the user might think. To get around this problem we need to replace flatMap with switchMap.\nWhat is switchMap?\nswitchMap is very similar to flatMap, but with a very important distinction. Any events to be merged into the trunk stream are ignored if a new event comes in. Here is a marble diagram showing the behavior of switchMap:\n\nIn short, every time an event comes down the stream, flatMap will subscribe to (and invoke) a new observable without unsubscribing from any other observable created by a previous event. \nswitchMap on the other hand will automatically unsubscribe from any previous observable when a new event comes down the stream.\n\nIf we apply switchMap to the above example, the response for ABC would be ignored and the suggestions for ABCX would remain.\n\n# Search operation by using custom filter\n\nhttps://www.code-sample.com/2016/07/create-angular-2-autocomplete-dropdown.html\n\n# Building a Real Time Search in Angular With RxJS\n\nhttps://alligator.io/angular/real-time-search-angular-rxjs/   (Use this in case of search operation)\n\nBelow is a simple Angular 2 app with a real time search to the cdnjs public API.

There are many API of route guards but in this article \n we will discuss CanActivate and CanActivateChild. Both API works in the same way. \n CanActivate and CanActivateChild are interfaces and have methods canActivate() and canActivateChild() respectively.\n These methods return Boolean value. CanActivate is used for authentication and CanActivateChild is used for authorization.\n To use route guards in our application, we need to create a service and implement these interfaces and define their methods. \n Angular Route interface provides canActivate and canActivateChild properties to configure service class \n which is implementing CanActivate and CanActivateChild interfaces. \nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot, Router} from '@angular/router';\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';\nimport { LocalStorageService } from './local-storage.service';\n@Injectable()\nexport class RoutingGuardGuard implements CanActivate {\n    constructor(private localStorageService:LocalStorageService, private router: Router) {}    \n  canActivate(next: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): boolean {\n   if (this.localStorageService.getLocalStorageData('claims') == null) {\n      alert('Activation blocked');\n      this.router.navigate(['./login']);\n      return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n  }\n}\nshow current time for login user with date and time\nhow to perform from to date action to show data with limit 10 and then use pagination.\nhttp://jasonwatmore.com/post/2016/08/23/angular-2-pagination-example-with-logic-like-google   (use it )\nhttps://plnkr.co/edit/oyFWJe?p=preview\nhttps://embed.plnkr.co/oyFWJe/\nhttp://www.cmarix.com/How-to-implement-Angular-2-Bootstrap-Pagination   (Angular 2 Bootstrap Pagination)\nhttps://angular-meteor.com/tutorials/socially/angular2/search-sort-pagination-and-reactive-vars  (Filter and Pagination)\nhttps://g00glen00b.be/pagination-component-angular-2/  (Creating a pagination component with Angular 2)\nhttps://www.js-tutorials.com/javascript-tutorial/angularjs-tutorial/html-table-listing-pagination-using-angular-4/  (HTML Table Listing With Pagination Using Angular 2/4)\nApply time and share time into parent component\nhttps://dmkcode.com/2016/08/simple-timer-using-angular-2-and-rxjs/\nList of all country data\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/chitranshu/worlddb/master/countries-flat.json\nAngular 2 Select Option + Multiple Select Option + Validation Example using Template-Driven Form\nhttps://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-select-option-multiple-select-option-validation-example-using-template-driven-form\nAll about angular modal\nhttps://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/modals\nCUSTOM EVENTS IN ANGULAR 2\nhttps://www.techifide.com/custom-events-in-angular-2/\ndetail ABOUT Observable AND ALSO TYPES OF ALL OPERATORS BASED ON REQUIREMENTS\nhttp://reactivex.io/rxjs/manual/overview.html#subject\nThe essential concepts in RxJS which solve async event management are:\nObservable:\nrepresents the idea of an invokable collection of future values or events.\nObserver:\nis a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable. An Observer is a consumer of values delivered by an Observable. Observers are simply a set of callbacks, one for each type of notification delivered by the Observable: next, error, and complete. The following is an example of a typical Observer object:\nvar observer = {\n  next: x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),\n  error: err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),\n  complete: () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification'),\n};\nTo use the Observer, provide it to the subscribe of an Observable:\nobservable.subscribe(observer);\nObservers are just objects with three callbacks, one for each type of notification that an Observable may deliver.\nObservers in RxJS may also be partial. If you don't provide one of the callbacks, the execution of the Observable will still happen normally, except some types of notifications will be ignored, because they don't have a corresponding callback in the Observer.\nThe example below is an Observer without the complete callback:\nvar observer = {\n  next: x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),\n  error: err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),\n};\nInternally in observable.subscribe, it will create an Observer object using the first callback argument as the next handler. All three types of callbacks may be provided as arguments:\nobservable.subscribe(\n  x => console.log('Observer got a next value: ' + x),  // first method call on success\n  err => console.error('Observer got an error: ' + err),  // second method call when error\n  () => console.log('Observer got a complete notification')  // third method call in last\n);\nSubscribing to Observables\nThe Observable observable in the example can be subscribed to, like this:\nobservable.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\nSubscribing to an Observable is like calling a function, providing callbacks where the data will be delivered to.\nSo subscribe is basically us to call the method of observable.\nExecuting Observables\nThe execution produces multiple values over time, either synchronously or asynchronously.\nThere are three types of values an Observable Execution can deliver:\n\"Next\" notification:\nsends a value such as a Number, a String, an Object, etc.Next notifications are the most important and most common type: they represent actual data being delivered to an Observer. \n\"Error\" notification:\nsends a JavaScript Error or exception.\n#\"Complete\" notification: \ndoes not send a value.\nError and Complete notifications may happen only once during the Observable Execution, and there can only be either one of them.\nDisposing Observable Executions:\nBecause Observable Executions may be infinite, and it's common for an Observer to want to abort execution in finite time, we need an API for canceling an execution. \nSince each execution is exclusive to one Observer only, once the Observer is done receiving values, it has to have a way to stop the execution, \nin order to avoid wasting computation power or memory resources.\nWhen observable.subscribe is called, the Observer gets attached to the newly created Observable execution. This call also returns an object, the Subscription:\nvar subscription = observable.subscribe(x => console.log(x)\nvar subscription = observable.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n// Later:\nsubscription.unsubscribe();\nSubscription:\nrepresents the execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for canceling the execution.A Subscription is an object that represents a disposable resource,\nusually the execution of an Observable. A Subscription has one important method, unsubscribe, that takes no argument and just disposes the resource held by the subscription.\nin previous versions of RxJS, Subscription was called \"Disposable\".\nvar observable = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\nvar subscription = observable.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n// Later:\n// This cancels the ongoing Observable execution which\n// was started by calling subscribe with an Observer.\nsubscription.unsubscribe();\nA Subscription essentially just has an unsubscribe() function to release resources or cancel Observable executions.\nSubscriptions can also be put together, so that a call to an unsubscribe() of one Subscription may unsubscribe multiple Subscriptions. You can do this by \"adding\" one subscription into another:\nvar observable1 = Rx.Observable.interval(400);\nvar observable2 = Rx.Observable.interval(300);\nvar subscription = observable1.subscribe(x => console.log('first: ' + x));\nvar childSubscription = observable2.subscribe(x => console.log('second: ' + x));\nsubscription.add(childSubscription);\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  // Unsubscribes BOTH subscription and childSubscription\n  subscription.unsubscribe();\n}, 1000);\nOperators:\nare pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like map, filter, concat, flatMap, etc.\nRxJS is mostly useful for its operators, even though the Observable is the foundation. Operators are the essential pieces that allow complex asynchronous code to be easily composed in a declarative manner.\nOperators are methods on the Observable type, such as .map(...), .filter(...), .merge(...), etc. When called, they do not change the existing Observable instance. Instead, they return a new Observable, whose subscription logic is based on the first Observable.\nAn Operator is essentially a pure function which takes one Observable as input and generates another Observable as output. Subscribing to the output Observable will also subscribe to the input Observables\ndebounceTime:\ndebounceTime delays values emitted by the source Observable, but drops previous pending delayed emissions if a new value arrives on the source Observable. This operator keeps track of the most recent value from the source Observable, and emits that only when dueTime enough time has passed without any other value appearing on the source Observable. If a new value appears before dueTime silence occurs, the previous value will be dropped and will not be emitted on the output Observable.\ndebounce:\ndebounce delays values emitted by the source Observable, but drops previous pending delayed emissions if a new value arrives on the source Observable. This operator keeps track of the most recent value from the source Observable, and spawns a duration Observable by calling the durationSelector function. The value is emitted only when the duration Observable emits a value or completes, and if no other value was emitted on the source Observable since the duration Observable was spawned. If a new value appears before the duration Observable emits, the previous value will be dropped and will not be emitted on the output Observable.\nswitch:\nSubject:\nis the equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers.\nThere are also a few specializations of the Subject type: BehaviorSubject, ReplaySubject, and AsyncSubject.\nSchedulers:\nare centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens on e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame or others.\nWhat is use of Templating meaning and example in angular2 all about template and when we need to use template\nWhat is use of *ngIF and else together in angular2\nngTemplateOutlet\nng-container\nng-template\ndirective with configuration to use it all over the application\ncall mudal in directive and use it inside the component\nFOCUS ALL ABOUT CUSTOM DIRECTIVE IN ANGULAR2\nImplementing Change Detection in custom directive\nhttps://teropa.info/blog/2016/03/06/writing-an-angular-2-template-directive.html\nhttps://www.codementor.io/christiannwamba/build-custom-directives-in-angular-2-jlqrk7dpw\nTypes of Directives\nAngular 2 categorizes directives into 3 parts:\n1- Directives with templates known as Components\n2- Directives that creates and destroys DOM elements known as Structural Directives\n3- Directives that manipulate DOM by changing behavior and appearance known as Attribute Directives\nclear the concept of  @Input() set in custom directive\n@Input() set is use in child component when we neeed to change the value of child component variable based on parent component variavle.\nChild.ts--\nimport { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-name-child',\n  template: '\"{{name}}\"'\n})\nexport class NameChildComponent {\n  private _name = '';\n  @Input()\n  set name(name: string) {\n    this._name = (name && name.trim()) || '';\n  }\n  get name(): string { return this._name; }\n}\nparent.ts\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-name-parent',\n  template: Master controls {{names.length}} names\n  \n})\nexport class NameParentComponent {\n  // Displays 'Mr. IQ', '', 'Bombasto'\n  names = ['Mr. IQ', '   ', '  Bombasto  '];\n}\nhttps://ngdev.space/angular-2-input-property-changes-detection-3ccbf7e366d2\nhttps://angular.io/guide/component-interaction\nThe most important difference with the way we created our attribute directive is how they are provided to the DOM. Attribute directive uses ElementRef and Renderer to render and re-render \nwhile structural directives use TemplateRef and ViewContainerRef to update the DOM content.\nall about EventEmitter in angular2\nhttps://angular.io/api/core/EventEmittereventEmmiter call every times when any changes occur but observable call only one time call second time is code of that observable run again\nalso use EventEmitter , EventEmitter , EventEmitter \ndifference between EventEmitter and observable --\nThere are three methods I have seen to manage change detection in Angular2.\n1- Observables\n2- EventEmitter.\n3- Dot Rule\nMy question is, all three implementations can work when subscribing to watch changes in data. How do you decide when to use one instead of the other, and what are the drawbacks of each.\nhttps://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-custom-event-binding-eventemitter-example\n Angular framework provides event binding using in-built event as well as custom event. Event binding is achieved using parenthesis () and on- keyword. When using parenthesis (), we need to write our event name inside it. When using on- keyword, on- is added as prefix with event name. \n Custom events are the EventEmitter instances. To create a custom event we need to create an instance of EventEmitter annotated by @Output().\nChild to Parent: Sharing Data via Output() and EventEmitter\n So we can use EventEmitter in that case when we need to share the data from child to parent and in that case we define EventEmitter with @output inside the child\n component and also call emit method and pass parameter inside the emit method and that parameteris the data inside the child component and that data\n need to share inside the parent.\n#inside the child component\n@Output() notify: EventEmitter = new EventEmitter();\n      message1: string = \"Hola Mundo!\"\n      onClick() {\n        this.notify.emit(this.message1); // Then this instance calls emit() method to emit payload which can be received by event object $event. \n      }\n#inside the parent --\n        \nonNotify(message:string):void {\n    this.parentTitle=message;\n  }\n\n   Name: {{parentTitle}}\n\n\nEventEmitter can also use to share data without parent child relation use it inside the service and patch data ninside the directive using subscribe\nand to use value from eventEmmiter we need to use subscribe also\nHow to subscribe to an event on a service in Angular2?\nWhen We receive value data using eventEmmiter inside the service the to use this value data inside the component I have to use subscribe inside the-typescript-static-code-analysis-tool-tslint-to-check-the-code-prior-to-the-code-10f1718a1c17\ncomponent to find changes data-api\nnav.service.ts\nimport {EventEmitter} from 'angular2/core';\nexport class NavService {\n  navchange: EventEmitter = new EventEmitter();\n  constructor() {}\n  emitNavChangeEvent(number) {\n    this.navchange.emit(number);\n  }\n  getNavChangeEmitter() {\n    return this.navchange;\n  }\n} \ncomponents.ts\nimport {Component} from 'angular2/core';\nimport {NavService} from '../services/NavService';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'obs-comp',\n  template: obs component, item: {{item}}\n})\nexport class ObservingComponent {\n  item: number = 0;\n  subscription: any;\n  constructor(private navService:NavService) {}\n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.subscription = this.navService.getNavChangeEmitter()\n      .subscribe(item => this.selectedNavItem(item));\n  }\n  selectedNavItem(item: number) {\n    this.item = item;\n  }\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n    this.subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }\n}\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-nav',\n  template:nav 1 (click me)\n    nav 2 (click me),\n})\nexport class Navigation {\n  item = 1;\n  constructor(private navService:NavService) {}\n  selectedNavItem(item: number) {\n    console.log('selected nav item ' + item);\n    this.navService.emitNavChangeEvent(item);\n  }\n}\nWhen I have to use Observable.of\n event.debounceTime(400)\n      .distinctUntilChanged()\n      .switchMap(term => this.studentserviceService.searchProductDetail(event))\n      .subscribe(results => {\n        this.results = results;\n    });\nAngular 2 – Creating a search field with debounce time\nhttp://www.talkinghightech.com/en/angular-2-creating-search-field-debounce-time/\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/32051273/angular-and-debounce\nwhat is use of asObservable--\nIntroduction to Angular 2 Observables\nhttps://www.javascripttuts.com/introduction-to-angular-2-observables/\nObservables are elements that will give us information. In order to get access to those information, we need to subscribe to them \nWhat do you mean by Consider AOT compilation. The Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler\nJust-in-Time (JiT) vs Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation\nAnd meaning of JIT is just before the app is run in your browser.\nThe Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler\nhttps://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler\nThe Angular Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler converts your Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build\n phase before the browser downloads and runs that code.\n Before the browser can render the application, the components and templates must be converted to executable JavaScript by an Angular compiler.\n Angular offers two ways to compile your application:\n1- Just-in-Time (JIT), which compiles your app in the browser at runtime\n2- Ahead-of-Time (AOT), which compiles your app at build time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n\n           \n       \n\n       \n\n

In simple words when you have new values let me know.\n    We can subscribe to the Subject and we can manually trigger the next() method. \n    When you call the next() method every subscriber will get this value.(you can also trigger error() and complete())\n    you can get an observable from behavior subject using the asobservable() method\n    \n    \n                        \n                    \n    \n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    Private\n                                searchUpdated\n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                            searchUpdated:     Subject\n    \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                Type :     Subject\n    \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                Default value : new Subject()\n                            \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Defined in src/app/search-student/search-student.component.ts:91\n                                \n                            \n    \n                    \n                        \n                            \n    BehaviorSubject -
